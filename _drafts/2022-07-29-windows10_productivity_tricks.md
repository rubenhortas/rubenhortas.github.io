I am writting this article as a result of a conversation I recently had with a friend.  
It was a very interesting conversation where, among others, we interchanged some Windows 10 tricks.  

## Clipboard history (clipboard on steroids)

Since 2018, Windows 10 has included a clipboard history that you can use to paste a list of recently copied items into any program.  
The clipboard history holds the most recent 25 text snippets, HTML, and images smaller than 4MB.  
You can delete history items or all history, and you also can pin elements to the history.  
The clipboard history is deleted each time you restart the computer and, if you use a microsoft account, you can sync your clipboard between devices using this account. 

To enable the clipboard history:

Start button > Settings > System > Clipboard > Clipboard history on

To use the clipboard history use the shortcut: **win+v**

## Paste plain text (text without format)

When pasting some text that you have copied to the clipboard some applications keep the formatting of the text and it becomes awkward to read.  
To remove formatting when pasting use the shortcut: **ctrl+shift+v**

## Snip&Sketch

Snip&Sketch is the integrated and most direct way to take a screenshot on Windows 10.  
You can take a rectangular, free form or full screen capture and you can customize, annotate and share you screenshot.  

To use Snip & Sketch use the shortcut: **win+shift+s**

## Bonus: Flameshot

[Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/) is my preferred way to do take an screenshot (on windows and gnu/linux). Sadly, in certain contexts does not work and you have to go back to Snip&Sketch :(

As they say in [their web](https://flameshot.org/): [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/) is a free and open-source, cross-platform tool to take screenshots with many built-in features to save you time.  
You can add arrows, hihglighting, blurring, text, draws, shapes, numbers (with an incrementing counter) and color boxes.  

You can take a look and download [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/) from [https://flameshot.org/](https://flameshot.org/) or from [https://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot](https://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot)

_Enjoy! ;)_
