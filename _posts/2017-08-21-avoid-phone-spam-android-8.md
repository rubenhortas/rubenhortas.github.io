How to prevent unwanted calls on an android 8 phone without having to install any application?

The first thing is create a contact in which we will store the numbers that we want to block (yes, I will use the original name "**SPAM**" for the contact).
Then we will add the numbers we want to block to the contact:
![Spam contact](android8SpamContact.jpeg){: width="250" }
_Contact SPAM_

Once the contact is created we edit it, and in the hamburger menu, we will select the option "Block contact":

![Contact hamburger menu](android8SpamContactHamburgerMenu.jpeg){: width="250" }
_Contact hamburger menu_

One the conctact is blocked we won't receive any calls or messages for these numbers from now on:
![Contact block question dialog](android8SpamContactBlockMessage.jpeg){: width="250" }
_Contact block question dialog_

_Enjoy! ;)_
