I did a simple widget to show the IPs of your VPN interface and your target machine (if is set) while you are playing in  [hack the box (hackthebox.com)](https://app.hackthebox.com/)  

It's also a good widget to see the IP of your VPN interface (and) if the interface is up

## Screenshots
- With target on

- With target off

If the VPN interface is down the widget is not shown.

_Enjoy! ;)_
