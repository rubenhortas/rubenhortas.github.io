## Challenge description

> Let's see if you're a QuickR soldier as you pretend to been

## Solution

I think this is a very easy challenge.
You only have to get the QR shown in console, read it and send the result of the equation that contains in less than tree seconds.

Although it's easy, it's fun and it's a good challenge to practice programming.

To solve this challenge I did a python script that you can see here: [quickr.py](https://github.com/rubenhortas/hackthebox/blob/main/quickr/quickr.py)
