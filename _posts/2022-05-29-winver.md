Sometimes we have to work by connecting to machines that we don't know what version of windows they are running.
And sometimes we have to know what is the exact version of windows to perform a specific task.  
To find out what version of Windows your device is running: press Win+R, type winver in the open box, and then select Ok.

_Enjoy! ;)_
