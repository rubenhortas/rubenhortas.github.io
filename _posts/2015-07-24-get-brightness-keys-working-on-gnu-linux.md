After install a new GNU/Linux distribution on my laptop it was working _almost_ all, but not the brightness key (or brightness buttons).
To solve this the solution was install xdotool and assign the commands "xdotool key XF86MonBrightnessUp" and
"xdotool key XF86MonBrightnessDown" to the volume keys.

_Enjoy! ;)_
