After install a new GNU/Linux distribution on my laptop it was working **almost** all, but not the brightness key (or brightness buttons).
To solve this the solution was install xdotool and assign the commands "xdotool key XF86MonBrightnessUp" (to raise the brightness) and
"xdotool key XF86MonBrightnessDown" to the up and down arrow keys.

_Enjoy! ;)_
