I have a new avatar!

_My new avatar_

The thruth is that I have a new whole collection of avatars thanks to my friend [Miguel Sislian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miguel-alejandro-sislian-suez).
[Miguel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miguel-alejandro-sislian-suez) is an artist, a hacktivist and currently is working as a UI/UX designer.
He is really good at what he does, and he did a whole bunch of avatars for me, so we choose the one that made us the most fun.

I had been with the same avatar for a long time, so I think it was time to change, and I really love this avatar.
So I guess it will be with me for quite some time.

I'm really thankful for the work and the laughts :)
