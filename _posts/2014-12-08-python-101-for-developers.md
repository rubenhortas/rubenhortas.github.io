[Coruña Developers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/CorunaDevelopers) ([@CorunaDev](https://twitter.com/corunadev)) is an initiative that has just emerged in A Coruña and aims to be a meeting point for developers. A place where you can talk, discuss and, above all, learn from other developers with more experience in other areas.

Last Friday I had the opportunity to inaugurate the talks with "[Python 101 for developers](https://github.com/rubenhortas/python101)". The talk is an introduction to Python, skipping basic things, emphasizing, above all, the differences, advantages and disadvantages that Python presents with respect to other programming languages. Leaving for the end certain annotations that I considered necessary, although I could not go deeper into them due to the extension of the topics to which they refer.

From here I want to thank the guys from [Coruña Developers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/CorunaDevelopers) for the opportunity and the experience (also the treatment received), and the attendees for the interest and curiosity shown. The truth is that for me it has been a very positive experience, and I hope it was productive for the attendees.

Although I know that for the non-attendees the slides and examples may be too short, by consensus with the organization and the attendees, I have decided to upload the material used (slides and code examples). While the services that will serve as common points to host all the material generated by the [Coruña Developers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/CorunaDevelopers) project are being created, I have uploaded [the slides and examples used](https://github.com/rubenhortas/python101) to [my github account](https://github.com/rubenhortas).

For non-attendees, this documentation may be short because it is out of context. Since it is simply support material (brief notes and simple examples) for the talk. Material that serves to provide structure, consistency and an argumentative thread to the narration. Material that, due to its format, leaves out certain topics and nuances that are commented on during the talk. However, it may still be of interest.

Personally, and after talking with the organizers about the ideas they have, I think it is a very interesting initiative. I am sure I will be there in future occasions, initially as an attendee, but who knows! Maybe in the future I will have the opportunity to repeat as a speaker ;)

You can follow the activities of [Coruña Developers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/CorunaDevelopers) on their facebook page: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/CorunaDevelopers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/CorunaDevelopers) and/or on their twitter: [@CorunaDev](https://twitter.com/corunadev)

_Enjoy! ;)_
