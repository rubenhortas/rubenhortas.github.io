I'm pleased to announce that, again, [I'm in La brecha](http://psi-udc.blogspot.com/2011/02/bloqueos-internet-que-hacemos.html).
This time with my _PFC_ (Proyecto Final de Carrera or Final Career Project) "Sistema de monitorizaci√≥n de redes WI-FI" (WI-FI network monitoring system).

A job that integrates both the world of systems and software development in a totally friendly environment for monitoring and detecting anomalies in WIFI networks.

My most sincere thanks to [Nino](linkedin.com/in/antonino-santos-del-riego-8b6975108) and [Fran](linkedin.com/in/francisco-javier-novoa-de-manuel-62517b29) for the work done and for being the best director and the best tutor I could have had.

_Enjoy! ;)_
