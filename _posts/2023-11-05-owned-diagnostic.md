## Description

> Our SOC has identified numerous phishing emails coming in claiming to have a document about an upcoming round of layoffs in the company. The emails all contain a link to diagnostic.htb/layoffs.doc. The DNS for that domain has since stopped resolving, but the server is still hosting the malicious document (your docker). Take a look and figure out what's going owned-diagnostic.
