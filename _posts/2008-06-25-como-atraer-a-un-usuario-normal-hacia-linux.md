Today I'm featured in an opinion article in [ionlitio (es)](https://www.ionlitio.com/): ["Como atraer a un usuario normal hacia Linux"](https://www.ionlitio.com/como-atraer-a-un-usuario-normal-hacia-linux/)

It's an article in which q256 (a great friend of mine IRL) explains how a non gnu/linux user sees the various types of gnu/linux users and their use of the system. I'm in the role of "hardcore user", and although I don't share all his opinions, I respect and appreciate them. And I thank him (really) for making me one of the protagonist of one of his articles.

Thanks, q256!

_Enjoy! ;)_
