Usually, the ideal is to have the minimum programs running at startup on windows, but sometimes we need to add some program to the startup.

To get a program to run at startup on Windows10:
* Press the keys: win+r
* On the run box write the next command: shell:startup
* Drag the shortcut to the program that we want to run at startup to the window that just opened.
* Reboot

_Enjoy! ;)_
