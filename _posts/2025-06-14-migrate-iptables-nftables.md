Learn the essential steps to migrate your Linux firewall configurations from iptables to nftables.
This guide covers syntax, commands, best practices for a smooth transition and offers a good set of essential rules.

## Why?

A while back, due to some changes in my home networks, I decided to harden my systems by implementing firewalls with iptables: [iptables essential rules. A starting point to protect your computer](https://rubenhortas.github.io/posts/iptables-essential-rules/).
And, to this day, I'm still very happy with the results.
However, as everything changes and evolves, the currently recommended firewall is nftables.
So I decided to upgrade myself, my systems, and migrate the firewalls to nftables.

## What is nftables?

nftables is developed by Netfilter, the same organization that currently maintains iptables.

nftables is a subsystem of the Linux kernel that provides filtering and classification of network packets/datagrams/frames.

nftables was first publicly presented at Netfilter Workshop 2008 by Patrick McHardy from the Netfilter Core Team.
The first preview release of kernel and userspace implementation was given in March 2009.

On 16 October 2013, Pablo Neira Ayuso submitted a nftables core pull request to the Linux kernel mainline tree.
It was merged into the kernel mainline on 19 January 2014, with the release of Linux kernel version 3.13.

nftables replaces the popular {ip,ip6,arp,eb}tablesreuses the existing Netfilter subsystems, and provides a new in-kernel packet classification framework based on a network-specific Virtual Machine (VM) and a new nft userspace command line tool.
This VM is able to execute bytecode to inspect a network packet and make decisions about how to handle it.

## Why ntables instead iptables?

Iptables is aging very well, but nftables is gaining ground.
The Netfilter project and the community are focused in replacing iptables with nftables.
And, nftables, offers us some advantages over iptables:

* It provides new structures that drastically reduces the number of rules needed to inspect a packet until reaching the final action.
* Faster packet classification.
* Simplified dual stack IPv4/IPv6 management (This avoids code duplication and inconsistencies).
* Nicer and more compact syntax

Basically, it avoids duplication of work and inconsistencies, is easier to configure and mantain and is faster.
I love working less! ;)

## Migrate from iptables to nftables

I'm going to explain how to migrate based on some initial rules that you can see in my post [iptables essential rules. A starting point to protect your computer](https://rubenhortas.github.io/posts/iptables-essential-rules/).
If you don't have any initial rules to work from, you will have to manually create your file and you can skip the next sections and jump to [Test your nftables ruleset](https://rubenhortas.github.io/posts/migrate-iptables-nftables/#test-your-nftables-ruleset).

### Backup iptables rules

```shell
sudo iptables-save  > /home/rubenhortas/backups/iptables/iptables/iptables_rules_v4~
sudo ip6tables-save > /home/rubenhortas/backups/iptables/iptables_rules_v6~
```

### Install nftables

```shell
sudo apt install nftables
```

### Translate iptables rules to nftables rules

```shell
sudo iptables-restore-translate -f /home/rubenhortas/backups/iptables/iptables/iptables_rules_v4~ > /home/rubenhortas/backups/nftables_rules_v4.nft
sudo ip6tables-restore-translate -f /home/rubenhortas/backups/iptables/iptables_rules_v6~ > /home/rubenhortas/backups/nftables_rules_v4.nft
```

### Review the rules (Coffee time! â˜•)

This is usually where I go to make a cup of coffee, because I spend a lot of time reviewing, sorting and commenting the generated rules ;)

I do this to make a mental map of the rules and needs, and later organize them.
Also, some complex iptables extensions might not translate perfectly and may require manual adjustment.

There is my nftables starting point:

```shell
# Set Default Policies (DROP everything first)
add table ip filter
add chain ip filter INPUT { type filter hook input priority 0; policy drop; }
add chain ip filter FORWARD { type filter hook forward priority 0; policy drop; }
add chain ip filter OUTPUT { type filter hook output priority 0; policy drop; }

add chain ip filter ICMP_IN
add chain ip filter ICMP_OUT
add rule ip filter INPUT ip protocol icmp counter jump ICMP_IN

Now, we can use these rules or we can (manually) create a nftables.conf file.

### Create a nftables.conf (more coffee! â˜•â˜•)

This is often preferred for a cleaner, more organized setup.
You'll define tables and chains explicitly:

```shell
#!/usr/sbin/nft -f

# Clear existing rules
flush ruleset

# Interfaces
define LAN_INTERFACE_IPV4 = 192.168.1.100
define LAN_INTERFACE_IPV6 = dead::beef

# Ports
define SSH_PORT = 22
define NFS_PORT = 2049
define HTTP_PORTS = { 80, 443 }
define DNS_PORTS = { 53, 853 }
define NTP_PORT = 123

# Using 'inet' family for rules that apply to both IPv4 and IPv6,
table inet filter {
    # Blacklisted IP addresses
    set blacklist_ipv4 {
        type ipv4_addr;
        flags interval;
        auto-merge;
        elements = { 169.254.0.0/16, 192.0.2.0/24, 224.0.0.0/4, 240.0.0.0/4, 255.255.255.255, 0.0.0.0/8 }
    }

    set blacklist_ipv6 {
        type ipv6_addr;
        flags interval;
        auto-merge;
        elements = { fe80::/10, 2001:db8::/32, ff00::/8, ::/128 }
    }

    # ICMP handling for incoming traffic (IPv4 & IPv6 consolidated)
    chain ICMP_IN {
        # Allow replies for established/related ICMP sessions
        icmp type { echo-reply, destination-unreachable, time-exceeded } ct state { related, established } counter accept
        icmpv6 type { 129, 1, 2, 3, 4 } ct state { related, established } counter accept # echo-reply, dest-unreachable, packet-too-big, time-exceeded, parameter-problem

        # Drop incoming echo-requests (ping) by default
        icmp type echo-request counter drop
        icmpv6 type echo-request counter drop
    }

    # ICMP handling for outgoing traffic (IPv4 & IPv6 consolidated)
    chain ICMP_OUT {
        # Allow outgoing echo-requests (ping) and established/related ICMP
        icmp type echo-request ct state { new, established } counter accept
        icmpv6 type echo-request ct state { new, established } counter accept
    }

    chain INPUT {
        type filter hook input priority 0; policy drop; # Default drop policy for incoming

        # Optimize order for performance:
        # High-volume, low-risk traffic first.
        # Specific drops before general accepts.

        # 1. Allow all traffic on the loopback interface (essential for local processes)
        iif "lo" accept

        # 2. Allow Established/Related Connections (VERY IMPORTANT, handles most ongoing traffic)
        ct state { related, established } counter accept

        # 3. Drop packets with invalid state (e.g., malformed, out-of-sync)
        ct state invalid counter drop

        # 4. Anti-spoofing and blacklisted IPs (fast drops for known bad traffic)
        # IPv4
        iif != "lo" ip saddr @blacklist_ipv4 counter drop
        ip saddr $LAN_INTERFACE_IPV4 counter drop # Deny incoming traffic from own IP

        #IPv6
        ip6 saddr @blacklist_ipv6 counter drop
        iif != "lo" ip6 saddr $LAN_INTERFACE_IPV6 counter drop

        # 5. Drop fragmented packets that are clearly invalid or cannot be reassembled
        ip frag-off != 0 ct state invalid counter drop

        # 6. Jump to ICMP chain
        meta l4proto { icmp, icmpv6 } counter jump ICMP_IN

        # 7. Legitimate services
        tcp dport { $SSH_PORT, $NFS_PORT } ct state new counter accept
        tcp sport $DNS_PORTS ct state new counter accept

        udp sport { $DNS_PORTS, $NTP_PORT } ct state new counter accept

        # 8. Basic port scanner protection
        ct state new limit rate 10/second burst 20 packets drop
    }

    chain FORWARD {
        type filter hook forward priority 0; policy drop;
    }

    chain OUTPUT {
        type filter hook output priority 0; policy drop; # Default drop policy for outgoing

        # 1. Allow all traffic on the loopback interface
        oif "lo" accept

        # 2. Allow Established/Related Connections
        ct state { related, established } counter accept

        # 3. Anti-spoofing for outgoing traffic
        # Deny outgoing traffic that does not have the source address of the system interface
        oif != "lo" ip saddr != $LAN_INTERFACE_IPV4 counter drop
        oif != "lo" ip6 addr != $LAN_INTERFACE_IPV6 counter drop

        # 4. Legitimate services
        tcp dport { $TORRENT_SERVER_PORTS, $DNS_PORTS, $HTTP_PORTS } ct state new counter accept
        tcp sport $NFS_PORT ct state new counter accept

        udp dport { $TORRENT_SERVER_PORTS, $TRACKER_PORTS, $DNS_PORTS, $NTP_PORT } ct state new counter accept
        udp sport $NFS_PORT ct state new counter accept

        # 5. Jump to ICMP_OUT chain for ICMP/ICMPv6 traffic
        meta l4proto { icmp, icmpv6 } counter jump ICMP_OUT
    }
}
```

Many of you may have noticed that I have set a static antispoofing configuration.
It's fine for this machine, since it only has a network interace and doesn't switch networks.
If you want a dynamic antisoofing configuration, you can read: [Dynamic IP antispoofing with nftables and NetworkManager](https://rubenhortas.github.io/posts/nftables-dynamic-antispoofing-networkmanager/).

### Test your nftables ruleset

#### Validate syntax

`sudo nft -c -f /home/rubenhortas/configs/nftables.conf`

If there's no output, the syntax is correct.

#### Test in coward mode

`sudo nft -f /home/rubenhortas/configs/nftables.conf && sleep 300 && sudo nft flush ruleset`

If anything goes wrong, the nftables rules will be flushed in 5 minutes.

Verify the rules with:

`sudo nft list ruleset`

You have 5 minutes to test your connections.
You can repeat these steps as many times as you want/need ;)

### Flush iptables rules

I flush my iptables and ip6tables at first, to make sure there are no rules in memory:

```shell
iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

iptables -t nat -F
iptables -t mangle -F
iptables -F
iptables -X
```

```shell
ip6tables -P INPUT ACCEPT
ip6tables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
ip6tables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

ip6tables -t nat -F
ip6tables -t mangle -F
ip6tables -F
ip6tables -X
```

### Disable and stop iptables services

Once we have verified that everything is working correctly, we can disable iptables services:

```shell
sudo systemctl disable --now iptables
sudo systemctl disable --now ip6tables
sudo systemctl disable --now netfilter-persistent # If you use iptables-persistent
```

### Uninstall iptables and netfilter-persistent

`sudo apt purge iptables netfilter-persistent`

### Delete /etc/iptables

`sudo rm -rf /etc/iptables`

### Find more iptables files (or folders)

You can also check if there are more iptables files on the system:

`sudo find / \( -path /proc -o -path ./usr \) -iname *ip?tables* 2>/dev/null`

### Copy our nftables.conf to /etc

To make the rules persistent, we must save them to a configuration file: `/etc/nftables.conf`.
The nftables service will start automatically on boot and load the rules from `/etc/nftables.conf`

`sudo cp /home/rubenhortas/configs/nftables.conf /etc/`

And we change the file permissions:

`sudo chown root:root /etc/nftables.conf`

### Enable and start nftables service

`sudo systemctl enable --now nftables`

### Reboot and check our nftables rules

After reboot, we can check our nftables rules again to ensure they load correctly and are persisted.

`sudo nft list ruleset`
