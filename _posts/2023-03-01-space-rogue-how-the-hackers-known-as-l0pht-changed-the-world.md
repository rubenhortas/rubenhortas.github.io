These days I read the [Chris Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cris_Thomas)' book: [Space Rogue How the hackers known as l0pht changed the world](https://www.spacerogue.net/wordpress/?p=869).

It is a great book and I recommend it. 
It's very entertaining and reads very quickly.
It was just as interesting for me to learn about l0pht's history and philosophy on computer security as it was about [Space Rogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cris_Thomas)'s history and personal anecdotes.
It was also an exercise in nostalgia to remember those not-so-old days.
The truth is that I spent a few hours enjoying it completely abstracted from everything :)

The fact is that on the front and back covers this binary code appears:

```
0100110101100001011010110110100101101110011001110010000001110100011010000110010100100000011101000110100001100101011011110111001001100101011101000110100101100011011000010110
1100001000000111000001110010011000010110001101110100011010010110001101100001011011000010000001110011011010010110111001100011011001010010000000110001001110010011100100110010
```

After reading the book, and knowing (a bit) about [Space Rogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cris_Thomas) and the [l0pht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L0pht) people, it could not be simple gibberish.
So, I took a while and started to transcribe and decipher it, and the result is:
