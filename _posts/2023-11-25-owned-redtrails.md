## Description

> Our SOC team detected a suspicious activity on one of our redis instance. Despite the fact it was password protected it seems that the attacker still obtained access to it. We need to put in place a remediation strategy as soon as possible, to do that it's necessary to gather more informations about the attack used. NOTE: flag is composed by three parts.
