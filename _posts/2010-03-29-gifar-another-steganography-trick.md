Since -relatively- recently, it has become more and more common to find articles about [steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography), until "recently" that great unknown. The vast majority of these articles talk about applications, whether known or new, and how we can camouflage one type of file inside another.

In the article [GIFAR otro "steganography trick" (es)](https://oldblog.pentester.es/2010/03/gifar-otro-steganograpy-trick.html), they talk about a technique that allows us to hide .jar files inside .gif and .pdf files, and how an attacker could exploit this technique presented at [BlackHat](https://www.blackhat.com/) US '08, one of the most important security events in the world. 

_Enjoy! ;)_
