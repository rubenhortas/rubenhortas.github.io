All our computers should be using a firewall.
Especially those that expose services to the internet.

Firewalls are crucial for mantaining the security of our network and protecting our data from external threats.
They serve as a first line of defense against malware, cyber criminals and another threaths.

In this times, it's a matter of minutes that botnets finds your exposed service and start attacking it.
And this could be the beginning of a bad story...

I have an old raspberry pi exposing a SSH service to the internet, I need to connect to it remotely.
The SSH access is secured using RSA authentication and fail2ban.
But, once botnets discovers the SSH service running, the raspberry begins to receive such amount of petitions that the router is "*ddosed*" and the internet connection starts to cut.
So I decided to set up a firewall to try to avoid network scans, at least those automated ones like those used by the botnets.
I decided on iptables due to hardware and software restrictions, and, while I was at it, I also added protections to other kind of attacks and restrictions.

I learned a lot along the way, and that's why I decided to put a configuration file here that I think it's a good starting point to harden our systems.

## Iptables bash script

Here's my iptables starting point rules (as bash script):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

bin="/sbin/iptables"

#Flush rules
$bin -P INPUT ACCEPT
$bin -P FORWARD ACCEPT
$bin -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
$bin -t nat -F
$bin -t mangle -F
$bin -F
$bin -X

# Set Default Policies (DROP everything first)
$bin -P INPUT DROP
$bin -P OUTPUT DROP
$bin -P FORWARD DROP

# Allow all traffic on the loopback interface (the internal 127.0.0.1 address. Essential for local processes).
$bin -A INPUT  -i lo -j ACCEPT
$bin -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT

# Drop packets with invalid state
$bin -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate INVALID -j DROP

# Allow Established/Related Connections (Crucial for allowing responses)
$bin -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
$bin -A OUTPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

# Block incoming traffic form the Zeroconf address range.
# This range is used by hosts that use DHCP to adquire their IP address.
# An address from this range is asigned when these hosts are unable to find a DHCP server to provide them an address.
# This range is also usded to provide addressing when connecting two devices using a crossover cable.
$bin -A INPUT -s 168.254.0.0/16 -j DROP

## Saving iptables rules

If we don't persist our rules, they will be deleted upon reboot.

The best and recommended way to make iptables rules persistent is by using the `iptables-persistent` package.

If we don't have `iptables-persistent` installed, we install it:

`sudo apt install iptables-persistent`

* During the installation, you will be prompted whether to save your current IPv4 and IPv6 rules. Choose "Yes" for both if you have already configured your firewall.

To save our current rulings (if we skipped during installation or we made changes):

`sudo netfilter-persistent save`

* The iptables-persistent service is automatically configured to load the rules from iptables (ipv4) and ip6tables (ipv6) during system startup.

If you are going to use this as configuration basis rember a few things:
* Check the configuration and **set the parameters of your computer** (e.g.: set your computer ip address, interface[s], and the packet limits of the rules).
* These are basically protection rules and only allows basic common services as DNS, SSH, NTP and HTTP[S]. Below you have to add the rules that allow legitimate services traffic from your host.
* Think about your computer needs. Every host has needs and they may not be the same as mine.
* I set these rules without specify interfaces.In some hosts different interfaces have different needs.
* In iptables the order of the rules matter.
* Using the `recent` or `limit`modules instead `hashlimit` could improve the performance.
* Don't forget about IPv6. These are rules for IPv4, but changing the `$bin` variable to use `ip6tables` could apply to IPv6.

I have to say that **I am no expert, and, therefore, these rules could be improved in many ways** (If this is the case, feel free to contact me and I'll be happy to update this post :) ).
