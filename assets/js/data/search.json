Interpreter mode: PyCharm searches for a Ruff executable installed in your interpreter. To install the Ruff package for the selected interpreter, click Install Ruff.

For this to take effect, the client and the server must be configured identically.Optimizing KexAlgorithmsThe Key Exchange (KEX) Algorithm determines how the client and server agree upon a shared secret key for the session.Older algorithms, such as those based on traditional Diffie-Hellman, are often slower.The best practice is to select modern, high-speed algorithms like those based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).The curve25519-sha256@libssh.org algorithm is the current gold standard for speed and security.KexAlgorithms curve25519-sha256@libssh.org,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256Optimizing CiphersThe Cipher is the encryption algorithm used to scramble the actual data being transferred.The fastest Ciphers are generally those that are designed to be efficiently processed on modern CPUs.A high-performance choice is ChaCha20-Poly1305, which is implemented in OpenSSH as chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com.This algorithm is often significantly faster than legacy AES-CBC modes, particularly on systems without AES acceleration (common in cloud VMs).Ciphers chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com The order matters.SSH client and server will choose the first common algorithm they both support from their respective lists.By placing the fastest algorithms at the beginning of the list, you ensure they are prioritized for maximum speed.Optimize SSH clientThe configuration fileTo optimize SSH, on the client side, we are going to change certain settings in the SSH configuration file ~/.ssh/config.This file defines custom configurations for the user and specific hosts or groups of hosts: Specific host configurationTo add a specific host, you simply create a new configuration block starting with the Host option and a unique alias for that host:Host rubenhortas-dev HostName 192.168.1.1 Compression yes ControlMaster auto ControlPath ~/.ssh/control_sockets/%r@%h:%p ControlPersist 600 KexAlgorithms curve25519-sha256@libssh.org,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256 Ciphers chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com LogLevel ERROR ...

If you have 5 keys in your ssh-agent, you might hit a limit of 3 before you even get to type a password or login.Disable X11 forwardingIf we are not going to use graphical applications via SSH, it is best to disable it.The main reason for disabling X11 forwarding is the possibility of an attacker gaining access to your local X server session if the remote SSH server is compromised.X11Forwarding noDisable TCP ForwardingBy disabling TCP forwarding prevents a compromised SSH session from being used as a bridge to attack other systems.If an attacker gains access to a limited user account, they can use TCP forwarding to bypass firewalls and poking around your internal network.Disabling TCP forwarding an attacker cannot tunner network traffic through the SSH connection.AllowTcpForwarding noDisable agent forwardingWe will disable agent forwarding because it creates a security risk by allowing the compromissed remote machine to use our local SSH private keys for any subsequent connection.AllowAgentForwarding noRestrict root loginOn a well-configured system, the root account should be disabled already.Disabling the root account and elevating privileges using sudo is a good security practice.Anyway, we are going to disable it:PermitRootLogin noLimit users and/or groups that can log in:We will specify which users and/or groups are allowed to access through SSH.AllowUsers rubenhortas rhortasAllowGroups rubenhortas rhortas ssh The users and groups are examples.You have to add your own users and groups.If a user is listed in AllowUsers or belongs to a group listed in AllowGroups, they are allowed access.If neither AllowUsers nor AllowGroups is specified, all users are permitted to log in (assuming they have credentials). You should consider using only one approach (AllowUsers or AllowGroups) if possible.My personal approach is to use only AllowUsers because I have few users to manage.Configure the idle timeoutWe are going to set up an inactiviy timeout to prevent sessions from remaining open indefinitely.ClientAliveInterval 300 # The server will send the client a message every 300 seconds if there is no activityClientAliveCountMax 2 # If the client does not respond to 2 messages in 10 minutes (300 x 2 = 600 seconds), the connection is terminated At this point, we have to be careful not to set values so restrictive that they cut off our connections. Alternatively, for non-SSH specific shell timeouts, consider using the TMOUT environment variable in the shell profile.Disable password authentication.Use only public/private key authentication.You can learn how to use RSA keys as authentication method here: SSH without password, using RSA keysAfter we have RSA key authentication set up and working, we are going to disable PasswordAuthentication:PasswordAuthentication noAnd we will to enable PubkeyAuthentication:PubkeyAuthentication yesExplicity enforce Protocol 2While modern SSH server software defaults to using the secure Protocol 2, and the modern and secure approach is to simply not specify the protocol, explicitly setting the directive could be a critical step in hardening our server.SSH Protocol 1is insecure and has known severe vulnerabilities.Explicty setting the configuration ensures that Protocol 1is never accepted, even if a client attempts to negotiate it.Protocol 2Force the use of modern algorithmsWe will define a strict list of preferred modern algorithms.The server’s list will determine the algorithms used if the client supports them.Key Exchange AlgorithmsWe need to harden our Key Exchange Algorithms using algorithms that uses modern elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and strong Diffie-Hellman methods, offering excellent security and performance.KexAlgorithms curve25519-sha256@libssh.org,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256MACs (integrity)MACs (Message Authentication Codes) ensure the data has not been tampered with in transit.We should prioritize Encrypt-then-MAC (EtM) algorithms.MACs hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,umac-128-etm@openssh.comCiphers (encryption)Ciphers encrypt the data channel.It’s best to prioritize Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) ciphers like chacha20-poly1305 and aes-gcm.Ciphers chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctrExplicity disable rhostsrhosts was a weak method to authenticate systems.

It defines the default configuration for all users on the system. To configure the values, we can uncomment the lines (if commented out) and edit the values. However, as I said before, I prefer to leave the original line commented out and place the line with the new value directly below it.

Crucially, if the key had changed on a host where it should not, the strict setting will prevent the connection entirelly, inmediately alerting me to a potential security issue.if the key had changed on a host where should not, I will find out something is wrong when I connect.StrictHostKeyChecking ask* First connection: the SSH client will prompt you to manually confirm if you trust the server's key before adding it to your `known_hosts` file.* Server key changed: The connection will be refused.StrictHostKeyChecking yes* First connection: The SSH client will refuse the connection immediately if the host's key is not already present in your `known_hosts` file.You must manually add the host key before attempting to connect.* Server key changed: The connection will be refused.Force the use of modern algorithmsOn the client side, we will enforce the same strong ciphers that we chose for the server.This will ensure that, even if we connect to a legacy server, we will use the best available options.Key Exchange AlgorithmsKexAlgorithms curve25519-sha256@libssh.org,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256MACs (integrity)MACs hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com,umac-128-etm@openssh.comCiphers (Encryption)Ciphers chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com,aes128-gcm@openssh.comDisable X11 forwardingAs on the server side, we will disable X11 forwarding to prevent exposing our graphical session.ForwardX11 noDisable agent forwardingAs on the server side, we will disable agent forwarding to prevent that a compromised server from using our keys to (potentially connect to other servers.ForwardAgent noAcknowledgmentsThanks to Rodrigo Rega and Alberto Mouriz for the advice.Thanks for reading! ;)" }, { "title": "Dynamic firewall rules with nftables and NetworkManager", "url": "/posts/dynamic-firewall-rules-nftables-network-manager/", "categories": "hardening, firewall", "tags": "hardening, firewall, iptables, nftables", "date": "2025-08-30 02:00:01 +0200", "snippet": "Dynamically implement IPv4 and IPv6 firewall rules for each network interface with nftables and NetworkManager.If the interface comes online or changes IP, the rules are automatically updated.If th...", "content": "Dynamically implement IPv4 and IPv6 firewall rules for each network interface with nftables and NetworkManager.If the interface comes online or changes IP, the rules are automatically updated.If the interface goes offline, the rules are automatically deleted.Why?I while ago I wrote about Migrate from iptables to nftables.More recently I wrote about How to prevent IP spoofing with nftables and NetworkManager.Yep, I’m into firewalling lately… :PThe thing is, as the iptables to nftables migration post is written in a single file (for simplicity and to use a server as an example), and IP spoofing (althoug is implemented dynamically) is only a part of protection, I decided to combine both, and explain how to dynamically manage firewall rules with nftables and NetworkManager.This implementation is geared toward everyday devices (desktops and/or laptops) where network interfaces may be available (or unavailable) and their IP addresses may change.Managing the firewall manually in these environments would be a horrible job, if not impossible.Update! After writing this post I found a better way to prevent IP spoofing with nftables using fib (Forwarding Information Base) module.The fib module is native to nftables and it has no dependencies.The fib module is faster and more reliable than fetching interface IPs with bash.Using this, we might even be able to do away with the 10-nftables-hotplug file and consolidate our nftables rules into a single file again.Using fib to prevent IP spoofing is as simple as adding the following line to our nftables rules:fib saddr type local dropSo, you can skip this post ;)The strategyThe strategy, for me, in these scenarios is simple: Keep the /etc/nftables.conf file as simple as possible and, then, implement rules dynamically for the interfaces with NetworkManager.nftables.confThis file should be kept as simple as possible.To achieve this, this file will only contain: Deny all rules: We will start from a deny all by default. Rules to allow all traffic for the loopback interface (lo): This is necessary for local applications and services to communicate with each other. ICMP rules: Since this rules will be applied per protocol and (in my case) the same ones will be applied to all interfaces. If you don’t want all ICMP rules to apply to all interfaces, or you want different ICMP rules to apply to different interfaces, don’t add these rules to the /etc/nftables.conf file and add them to the interface file(s).#!/usr/sbin/nft -f#/etc/nftables.conf# Clear existing rulesflush ruleset# Using 'inet' family for rules that apply to both IPv4 and IPv6table inet filter { # Blacklisted IP addresses set blacklist_ipv4_static { type ipv4_addr; flags interval; auto-merge; elements = { 169.254.0.0/16, 192.0.2.0/24, 224.0.0.0/4, 240.0.0.0/4, 255.255.255.255, 0.0.0.0/8 }; } set blacklist_ipv4 { type ipv4_addr; flags dynamic; } set blacklist_ipv6_static { type ipv6_addr; flags interval; auto-merge; elements = { fe80::/10, 2001:db8::/32, ff00::/8, ::/128 }; } set blacklist_ipv6 { type ipv6_addr; flags dynamic; } # ICMP handling for incoming traffic (IPv4 &amp; IPv6) chain ICMP_IN { # Allow replies for established/related ICMP sessions icmp type { echo-reply, destination-unreachable, time-exceeded } ct state { related, established } accept icmpv6 type { 129, 1, 2, 3, 4 } ct state { related, established } accept # echo-reply, dest-unreachable, packet-too-big, time-exceeded, parameter-problem # Drop incoming echo-requests (ping) by default icmp type echo-request drop icmpv6 type echo-request drop } # ICMP handling for outgoing traffic (IPv4 &amp; IPv6) chain ICMP_OUT { # Allow outgoing echo-requests (ping) and established/related ICMP icmp type echo-request ct state { new, established } accept icmpv6 type echo-request ct state { new, established } accept } chain INPUT { type filter hook input priority 0; policy drop; # Default drop policy for incoming # Allow all traffic on the loopback interface (essential for local processes) iif \"lo\" accept } chain FORWARD { type filter hook forward priority 0; policy drop; } chain OUTPUT { type filter hook output priority 0; policy drop; # Default drop policy for outgoing # Allow all traffic on the loopback interface oif \"lo\" accept }}The rules for interfacesWe create the script 10-nftables-hotplug in /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/ (as root) with the following content (the script is self explainatory):At this point, we can create one file for all interfaces or one file for each interface.To maintain a single file, if I needed other rules depending on the interface, I would handle the cases through conditionals in the code of this script.I prefer to keep a single file, but this, as always, will depend on each user’s preferences and needs.#!/usr/bin/env bash# /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/10-nftables-hotplug# $1 = interface name# $2 = connection statusdelete_rules() { interface=$1 chain=$2 handles=$(sudo nft -a list chain inet filter $chain | grep \"ifname \\\"$interface\\\"\" | awk '{print $NF}') if [ -n \"$handles\" ]; then for handle in $handles; do sudo nft delete rule inet filter $chain handle $handle done fi}# Delete old rulesdelete_rules \"$1\" INPUTdelete_rules \"$1\" OUTPUTif [[ \"$1\" != lo &amp;&amp; (\"$2\" = \"up\" || \"$2\" = \"dhcp4-change\" || \"$2\" = \"dhcp6-change\") ]]; then # Add rules to the INPUT chain # 1.

Bypass authentication Some systems rely on IP address authentication.If an attacker can spoof that IP, he will be able to access the “protected” resources. Masking identity By spoofing the source IP, an attacker remains anonymous thorough the attack.This makes incredibly difficult for sysadmins trace the attack back to its origin. Adding dynamic IP spoofing rules to nftables to avoid IP spoofing For this to work we need to have the “INPUT” table and the “filter” chanin created.We create the script 10-nftables-anti-spoofing in /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/ (as root) with the following content (the script is self explainatory):#!/usr/bin/env bash# $1 = interface name# $2 = connection statusdelete_rules() { local interface=\"$1\" local family=\"$2\" nft -a list ruleset | grep \"iifname \\\"$interface\\\" $family \" | while read -r line; do handle=$(echo \"$line\" | sed -n 's/.* handle \\([0-9]*\\).*/\\1/p') if [ -n \"$handle\" ]; then nft delete rule inet filter INPUT handle \"$handle\" fi done}# When an interface is connected or its configuration changedif [ \"$2\" = \"dhcp4-change\" ]; then\tipv4=$(ip addr show $1 | awk '$1==\"inet\"{gsub(\"/.*\",\"\",$2); print $2; next}')\tipv6=$(ip addr show $1 | awk '$1==\"inet6\"{gsub(\"/.*\",\"\",$2); print $2; next}') # Delete old rules \tif [ -n \"$ipv4\" ]; then \t\tdelete_rules \"$1\" \"ip\" # Delete old anti-spoofing rules for the interface and family \t nft add rule inet filter INPUT iifname \"$1\" ip saddr \"$ipv4\" drop # Add new anti-spoofing rules \tfi \tif [ -n \"$ipv6\" ]; then \t\tdelete_rules \"$1\" \"ip6\" # Delete old anti-spoofing rules for the interface and family \t nft add rule inet filter INPUT iifname \"$1\" ip6 saddr \"$ipv6\" drop # Add new anti-spoofing rules \tfifi Scripts placed in /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/ should be named with a number (between 00 and 99) followed by a descriptive number.The naming convention it’s XX-name.NetworkManager executes these scripts in numerical order from lowest to highest.We give execution permissions to the script:sudo chmod +x /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/10-nftables-anti-spoofingNow, the script will be executed automatically when we connect or disconnect a network interface or whe we change its configuration.Enjoy! ;)" }, { "title": "Migrate from iptables to nftables.

A starting point to protect your computer.And, to this day, I’m still very happy with the results.However, as everything changes and evolves, the currently recommended firewall is nftables.So I decided to upgrade myself, my systems, and migrate the firewalls to nftables.What is nftables?nftables is developed by Netfilter, the same organization that currently maintains iptables.nftables is a subsystem of the Linux kernel that provides filtering and classification of network packets/datagrams/frames.nftables was first publicly presented at Netfilter Workshop 2008 by Patrick McHardy from the Netfilter Core Team.The first preview release of kernel and userspace implementation was given in March 2009.On 16 October 2013, Pablo Neira Ayuso submitted a nftables core pull request to the Linux kernel mainline tree.It was merged into the kernel mainline on 19 January 2014, with the release of Linux kernel version 3.13.nftables replaces the popular {ip,ip6,arp,eb}tablesreuses the existing Netfilter subsystems, and provides a new in-kernel packet classification framework based on a network-specific Virtual Machine (VM) and a new nft userspace command line tool.This VM is able to execute bytecode to inspect a network packet and make decisions about how to handle it.Why ntables instead iptables?Iptables is aging very well, but nftables is gaining ground.The Netfilter project and the community are focused in replacing iptables with nftables.And, nftables, offers us some advantages over iptables: It provides new structures that drastically reduces the number of rules needed to inspect a packet until reaching the final action. Faster packet classification. Simplified dual stack IPv4/IPv6 management (This avoids code duplication and inconsistencies). Nicer and more compact syntaxBasically, it avoids duplication of work and inconsistencies, is easier to configure and mantain and is faster.I love working less! ;)Migrate from iptables to nftablesI’m going to explain how to migrate based on some initial rules that you can see in my post iptables essential rules. A starting point to protect your computer.If you don’t have any initial rules to work from, you will have to manually create your file and you can skip the next sections and jump to Test your nftables ruleset.Backup iptables rulessudo iptables-save &gt; /home/rubenhortas/backups/iptables/iptables/iptables_rules_v4~sudo ip6tables-save &gt; /home/rubenhortas/backups/iptables/iptables_rules_v6~Install nftablessudo apt install nftablesTranslate iptables rules to nftables rulessudo iptables-restore-translate -f /home/rubenhortas/backups/iptables/iptables/iptables_rules_v4~ &gt; /home/rubenhortas/backups/nftables_rules_v4.nftsudo ip6tables-restore-translate -f /home/rubenhortas/backups/iptables/iptables_rules_v6~ &gt; /home/rubenhortas/backups/nftables_rules_v4.nftReview the rules (Coffee time! ☕)This is usually where I go to make a cup of coffee, because I spend a lot of time reviewing, sorting and commenting the generated rules ;)I do this to make a mental map of the rules and needs, and later organize them.Also, some complex iptables extensions might not translate perfectly and may require manual adjustment.There is my nftables starting point:# Set Default Policies (DROP everything first)add table ip filteradd chain ip filter INPUT { type filter hook input priority 0; policy drop; }add chain ip filter FORWARD { type filter hook forward priority 0; policy drop; }add chain ip filter OUTPUT { type filter hook output priority 0; policy drop; }# Allow all traffic on the loopback interface (the internal 127.0.0.1 address.

Configuring trusted publishingTrusted publishing exchanges short-lived tokens (using OpenID Connect (OIDC)) between a trusted third-party service (in our case GitHub) and testpypi.org and/or pypi.org.Trusted publishing method can be used in automated environments and eliminates the need to use manually generated API tokens to authenticate with testpypi.org and/or pypi.org when publishing.The steps to crete a [pending] publisher in testpypi.org and pypi.org, are basically the same. I had the project upload to testpypi.org and pypi.org, but If you don’t have your project uploaded yet, you can create a “pending” trusted publisher.Configuring trusted publishing in testpypiWe go to our testpypi.org account, we go to “Your projects” and we select our project (in my case fail2bangeolocation), and we click in “Manage”:testpypi manage your projectWe go to “Publishing”:testpypi publishingUnder “Trusted Publisher Management” we add a new publisher:testpypi new publisherHere we will set the owner, the repository name, the workflow name and the environment name: Owner: Our github user.

Enviromnment name: The name of the GitHub Actions environment that the workflow will use, here I will use “testpypi”. We have to pay attention to the workflow and environment names.We will need them later.Click on “Add” and we are done! ;) It should be noted that, many times, we will not be able to install the package generated in testpypi in on our machine (or it may not work) due to dependency problems.This is because the same packages (or the same versions) may not be available in testpypi as in pypi.Configuring trusted publishing in pypi:We go to our pypi.org account, we go to “Your projects” and we select our project (in my case fail2bangeolocation), and we click in “Manage”:pypi manage your projectWe go to “Publishing”:pypi publishingUnder “Trusted Publisher Management” we add a new publisher:pypi new publisherHere we will set the owner, the repository name, the workflow name and the environment name: Owner: Our github user.

We have to pay attention to the workflow and environment names.We will need them later.Click on “Add” and we are done! ;)Adding the workflow The worflow file name has to match the name we gave it when we created the trusted trusted-publishersGitHub CI/CD workflows are declared in YAML files stored in the .github/workflows/ directory of our repositories.So, we can create a .github/workflows/publish.yml file, or, we can create it from the GitHub web interface.To create the action from the GitHub web interface, we go to our repository and select “Actions”:GitHub actionsNow, we will see some suggested actions for our repository, but, this time, we will create our own clicking in “set up a workflow yourself”:Get started with GitHub Actions - Set up a workflow yourselfIn the editor, we have to create a workflow with a file name that matches the name we gave it when we created the trusted-publishers:New workflowWe write (or paste) our workflow, we commit the changes and we are ready to publish!The workflow The environment names have to match with the enviroment names we gave them wen we created the trusted-publishers.You can see my workflow here: fail2bangeolocation publish.yml, but I’m going to copy it and explain it (briefly) here below:name: Publish Python distribution 🐍📦# The workflow is triggered when events taht include that includes tagas starting with v*.*.* or test_v*.*.*. are sent to the repository.on: push: tags: - 'v*.*.*' - 'test_v*.*.*'jobs:# Builds the pythond distribution (wheel and source tarball) build: name: Build distribution 📦 runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v4 # Checkout the code - name: Set up Python uses: actions/setup-python@v5 # Set up the Python environment with: python-version: \"3.x\" - name: Install pypa/build # Install the build tool run: &gt;- python3 -m pip install build --user - name: Build a binary wheel and a source tarball run: python3 -m build # Build the package - name: Store the distribution packages # Temporarily store the build artifacts in the dist directory under the name python-package-distributions uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4 with: name: python-package-distributions path: dist/# Publishes the built package to TestPyPI (for testing) if the tag starts with test_v.* publish-to-testpypi: name: Publish to TestPyPI 🐍📦 needs: - build # Start the job only if the build job has completed runs-on: ubuntu-latest environment: name: testpypi # Enter the environment name set in the Publisher url: https://test.pypi.org/p/example-package-hanaosan0318 # Project URL permissions: id-token: write # Grant Publishing permissions if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/test_v') # Conditional check for TestPyPI publishing steps: - name: Download all the dists # Download the build artifacts that were saved earlier uses: actions/download-artifact@v4 with: name: python-package-distributions path: dist/ - name: Publish distribution 📦 to TestPyPI # Publish to TestPyPI uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1 with: repository-url: https://test.pypi.org/legacy/Publishes the built package to PyPI (production) if the tag starts with v.* publish-to-pypi: name: Publish to PyPI 🐍 📦 needs: - build # Start the job only if the build job has completed runs-on: ubuntu-latest environment: name: pypi # Enter the environment name set in the Publisher url: https://pypi.org/p/example-package-hanaosan0318 # Project URL permissions: id-token: write if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/v') # Conditional check for PyPI publishing steps: - name: Download all the dists uses: actions/download-artifact@v4 with: name: python-package-distributions path: dist/ - name: Publish distribution 📦 to PyPI uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1 github-release: name: Create GitHub Release with source code 📦 needs: - publish-to-pypi # Start the job only if the PyPI publishing job has completed runs-on: ubuntu-latest permissions: contents: write # Grant permission to create a GitHub release steps: - name: Checkout code uses: actions/checkout@v4 # Checkout the code # I had to escape the braces in the following block.

If a v*.*.* tag (e.g. v1.0.1) is pushed, the relase version will be generated.The workflow will build the packages, upload them to pypi.org and generate the GitHub release. Why I decided to write my own workflow?The reason why I decided to write my own workflow is because the workflows I saw depended on other events, and, usually, they did a lot of work together (as publish to testpypi.org, pypi.org and generate the GitHub release at the same time).I prefer a slightly more structured workflow, based on pushing version tags. And, I want to perform slightly different actions based on these tags.Publishing the test version first in testpypi.org let me know if there are any errorsm and let me know the result of the distribution files.Once I have verified that the upload to testpypi.org is correct, and the distribution files have been checked, I can generate the production version, upload it to pypi.org and generate the GitHub release.Why I wanted to publish based on tags?When you upload a package to testpypi.org or pypi.org, you can’t repeat versions.With this workflow I can create a dev branch to add changes and upload test versions to testpypi.org.In case there are errors when uploading to testpypi.org, I can increase the project version, until everything is correct, without affecting the production version number.Once everything is correct I can merge the dev branch changes into the main branch, tag the production version in main, and the production release will be generated automatically (ideally without errors).Once the release version is published I will take care of cleaning up the versions in testpypi.org, and, if necessary, in pypi.org.Enjoy! ;)" }, { "title": "Organize your dotfiles with git", "url": "/posts/git-dotfiles/", "categories": "git, dotfiles", "tags": "git, dotfiles", "date": "2024-10-13 02:00:01 +0200", "snippet": "What are dotfiles?Dotfiles are files where the programs store their configuration.Dotfiles are named that way because most of them starts with a dot “.”, although, nowadays, it’s common to use thi...", "content": "What are dotfiles?Dotfiles are files where the programs store their configuration.Dotfiles are named that way because most of them starts with a dot “.”, although, nowadays, it’s common to use this term to refer to any configuration file.When you install a new program, you spend a lot of time reading documentation and trying and setting options, until fits you well.Some examples of programs that uses dotfiles are: bash, zsh, git, tmux, vim…In addition to these, I like to save another dotfiles (like .xprofile) and another configuration files (awesomewm, neovim, mplayer, yt-dlp, conky…).Saving these dotfiles (or configuration files) will save you a lot of time, and will allow you to mantain a consistency between computers.And I love these two things.Let’s say that you uninstalled some of these programs, or you are doing a fresh install of your operating system, or, maybe, you are installing some of these programs in another computer.After install these programs, you will only have to override their dotfiles (or config files) and everything will be to your liking and the same between systems/computers (if applicable).I have many computers, all but one, using gnu/linux.I keep some configs of all of them, some scripts or batch files (yep, it’s very useful backup these too) and even the wallpaper.Is true that we can do this with a simple backup in any hard drive, but let’s face it, we are programmers; and have the dotfiles backuped in a remote (and always available) git server (as github) is very comfortable.The “all in one” approachThis was my first approach.This approach consists of having one repository with only one branch. Then we will structure everything in folders.Once we had cloned our repository, we will delete our local dotfiles (or config files) and make symlinks to the files in the repository.My choice is to do hard links for files and soft links for the folders, but as you like ;)We will have something like this:dotfiles├── linux│   ├── common│   │   ├── configs│   │   │   ├── aliases│   │   │   ├── awesome│   │   │   ├── nvim│   │   │   ├── .tmux│   │   │   ├── .vimrc│   │   │   └── yt-dlp.conf│   │   ├── .mplayer│   │   └── scripts│   │   └── script1│   ├── desktop│   │   ├── configs│   │   │   ├── .bashrc│   │   │   ├── conky.conf│   │   │   ├── .gitconfig│   │   │   ├── .xprofile│   │   │   └── .zshrc│   │   ├── scripts│   │   │   ├── script1│   │   │   └── script2│   │   └── wallpaper│   │   └── wallpaper.jpg│   ├── laptop1│   │   ├── configs│   │   │   ├── .bashrc│   │   │   ├── .gitconfig│   │   │   ├── .xprofile│   │   │   └── .zshrc│   │   ├── scripts│   │   │   ├── script1│   │   └── wallpaper│   │   └── wallpaper.jpg│   └── laptop2│   ├── configs│   │   ├── .bashrc│   │   ├── .gitconfig│   │   ├── .xprofile│   │   └── .zshrc│   ├── scripts│   │   ├── script1│   │   └── script2│   │   └── script3│   └── wallpaper│   └── wallpaper.jpg└── windows ├── configs │   ├── config1.cfg │   └── config2.cfg ├── scripts │   ├── batch1.bat │   └── batch2.bat └── wallpaper └── wallpaper.jpgPros Very easy to mantain. One repository, one branch.It’s very easy to keep track of the changes.You have the same repository and the same branch in all of your machines. Common files are easily synchronized If we use a common directory to store the dotfiles that are the same in all the machines, we can keep our common configuration files easily synchronized. Cons Fragmentation Over time we will have fragmented configurations (if we use the common folder).In the worst case, we will get rid of the common directory. Useless configurations Wether we have it or not the common folder, we will have a lot of files (configurations, scripts, wallpapers…) from other computers that will be, mostly, useless for us in the current computer. The “m-branches” approachThis is my current approach, it’s similar to the “all in one” approach.We will have one repository, but one branch per machine (that’s why the “m” in the name).Each branch will contain only the dotfiles for one computer.We will have something like this:dotfiles/desktop├── configs│   ├── aliases│   ├── awesome│   ├── .bashrc│   ├── conky.conf│   ├── .gitconfig│   ├── .mplayer│   ├── nvim│   ├── .tmux│   ├── .vimrc│   ├── .xprofile│   ├── yt-dlp.conf│   └── .zshrc├── scripts│   ├── script1│   └── script2└── wallpaper └── wallpaper.jpgPros We will have only the files related to the current machine.Cons Management can get a little complicated If we make a change to a file that we want to push to other machines, we will have to do it manually on the other branches. If we create a file on one machine that we want to have on other machines, we will have to do it manually or propagate it with git to the other branches. Branch switching If you change branches, while your aren’t in the current computer branch, your links will break.So, If you need to switch branch, for whatever reason, it’s better to clone the repository (again) in another location. The “StreakyCobra” approachThis is the better approach. Why? Look at this name, how can it not be the best with this name?I saw this method in a Hacker news thread: Ask HN: What do you use to manage dotfiles?.This was the response given by the user StreakyCobra.This is going to be by next system (as soon as I feel like reorganizing some machine).This method is similar to the “m-branches”, one repository and one branch per machine, with the difference that this method does not need extra tools or symlinks.So, we will end having something similar to the “m-branches”, but more comfortable to manage.Creating the repositoryIf you don’t have the repository yet, you need to create it:git init --bare $HOME/.git_dotfiles # Creates the new repository. Replace with your own path.Cloning the repositoryIf you have the repository, you have to clone it.If you have your home directory empty (is not the usual thing), you can clone the repository: git clone --separate-git-dir=$HOME/.git_dotfiles https://path/to/repo $HOME –separate-git-dir=$HOME/.git_dotfiles: This option specifies that the Git repository configuration should be stored in the directory $HOME/.git_dotfiles instead of the usual .git subdirectory within the cloned repository. /path/to/repo: The URL or path to the Git repository that you want to clone. $HOME: This is the path where you want to clone the repository. If you don’t have your $HOME directory empty, you will need to clone it in a temporary directory and then delete the temporary directory:git clone --separate-git-dir=$HOME/.git_dotfiles https://path/to/repo $HOME/myconf-tmprm -r $HOME/myconf-tmp/Create the “dotfiles” aliasWe define an alias named “dotfiles” that executes git commands using the specified repository and hides the untracked files.alias dotfiles='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.git_dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME'To make the alias permanent, we need to add it to our shell’s configuration file (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc). The creation of the alias dotfiles avoids interference when we use the git command in other repositories. StreakyCobra uses an alias called config. I prefer dotfiles, it’s more clear for me.Ignore untracked filesdotfiles config status.showUntrackedFiles noBy ignoring untracked files we will have a cleaner output, in which we will only be shown changes to the files we have in the repository.Managing filesAny file can be versioned with normal commands, but you have to replace the git command by the alias dotfiles.dotfiles statusdotfiles add .vimrcdotfiles commit -m \"Add vimrc\"dotfiles pushCloning the repository in a new machineThe normal cloning will fail if the home directory is not empty.When we will clone the repository in a new machine, we will have to clone the repository into a temporary directory and then delete this temporary directory.git clone --separate-git-dir=$HOME/.git_dotfiles https://path/to/repo $HOME/myconf-tmpcp $HOME/myconf-tmp/.gitmodules $HOME # If you use git submodulesrm -r $HOME/myconf-tmp/alias dotfiles='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.git_dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME'Pros No need to create symlinks. We will have only the files related to the current machine.Cons Needs an alias to do not interfere with the git command in other repositories. We will have to manage the files more carefully. We will have to delete a (temporary) directory.

Neovim.Do I have to do a bash script? Neovim.Do I have to do a little python script? Neovim.Vim and Neovim are very lightweight and very powerful.Vim comes installed in (almost) every linux distro, and they are very convenient to use via ssh.Although for medium or large python projects my favorite IDE is Pycharm (I really love Pycharm), for small and fast (or no so fast scripts) I preffer neovim or vim, depends on which one is installed.The point is that, while I was coding some python scripts, above all using new libraries, I missed some features provided by a IDE.Features I was used to in Pycharm, as autocomplete and linting (analzing source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, etc.).So, I decided it was time to configure Neovim to improve my python experience.Neovim base configurationThis is my universal configuration that I use across all my machines, regardless of the task.This configuration will be the base to which I’ll add the python configuration.~/.config/nvim/init.vim:\" ==============================================================================\" CORE FUNCTIONALITY AND FILETYPE\" ==============================================================================syntax on \" Enable syntax highlightingfiletype plugin indent on \" Enable filetype detection, plugins, and smart indentationset encoding=utf-8 \" Set file and terminal encoding to UTF-8\" ==============================================================================\" INDENTATION AND TABS (Using 4-space soft tabs)\" ==============================================================================set autoindent \" Copy indentation from the previous lineset smartindent \" Enable smarter automatic indentationset expandtab \" Use spaces instead of actual tabsset tabstop=4 \" A Tab character is rendered as 4 spaces wideset shiftwidth=4 \" Auto-indent commands (e.g., &gt;&gt;) use 4 spacesset softtabstop=4 \" Tab/Backtab keys use 4 spaces when inserting\" Forzar 4 espacios específicamente en C/C++ para evitar overridesaugroup FileTypeSettings autocmd!

Vim Better WhitespaceThis plugin highlights all trailing whitespaces.It’s completely optional and can be replaced by the option “lines” in the vim.init file, but I like it. We need to create the directory where we will install the plugins.I install my plugins in ~/.config/nvim/plugins, so:mkdir ~/.config/nvim/plugins``nvim-lspconfigTo install it, we add the plugin to our init.vim file, into the call plug#begin('~/.config/nvim/plugins') section, below all the lines:call plug#begin('~/.config/nvim/plugins')...Plug 'neovim/nvim-lspconfig'call plug#end()nvim-cmpA completion engine plugin for neovim written in Lua.Completion sources are installed from external repositories and “sourced”.To install it we need to add the following to our init.vim file (respecting the blocks, if exists):call plug#begin('~/.config/nvim/plugins')Plug 'hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp'Plug 'hrsh7th/cmp-buffer'Plug 'hrsh7th/cmp-path'Plug 'hrsh7th/cmp-cmdline'Plug 'hrsh7th/nvim-cmp'\" For vsnip users.Plug 'hrsh7th/cmp-vsnip'Plug 'hrsh7th/vim-vsnip'call plug#end()lua &lt;&lt;EOF -- Set up nvim-cmp. local cmp = require'cmp' cmp.setup({ snippet = { -- REQUIRED - you must specify a snippet engine expand = function(args) vim.fn[\"vsnip#anonymous\"](args.body) -- For `vsnip` users. -- require('luasnip').lsp_expand(args.body) -- For `luasnip` users. -- require('snippy').expand_snippet(args.body) -- For `snippy` users. -- vim.fn[\"UltiSnips#Anon\"](args.body) -- For `ultisnips` users. end, }, window = { -- completion = cmp.config.window.bordered(), -- documentation = cmp.config.window.bordered(), }, mapping = cmp.mapping.preset.insert({ ['&lt;C-b&gt;'] = cmp.mapping.scroll_docs(-4), ['&lt;C-f&gt;'] = cmp.mapping.scroll_docs(4), ['&lt;C-Space&gt;'] = cmp.mapping.complete(), ['&lt;C-e&gt;'] = cmp.mapping.abort(), ['&lt;CR&gt;'] = cmp.mapping.confirm({ select = true }), -- Accept currently selected item.

Also, replace the ‘YOUR_LSP_SERVER’ value with ‘pylsp’, our Language Server Protocol (LSP).Vim Better WhitespaceThis plugin causes all trailing whitespace characters to be highlighted.Whitespace for the current line will not be highlighted while in insert mode.It is possible to disable current line highlighting while in other modes as well.A helper function :StripWhitespace is also provided to make whitespace cleaning painless.This plugin is optional, and can be substituded by the “lines” option in the vim.init file.But, I like it, and the :StripWhitespace function is very useful.To install it we add the plugin to our init.vim file, into the call plug#begin('~/.config/nvim/plugins') section, below all the lines:call plug#begin('~/.config/nvim/plugins')...Plug 'ntpeters/vim-better-whitespace'call plug#end()Installing the pluginsTo install the plugins we open nvim and run::PlugInstallIgnoring errorsI find quite annoying the “E501 line too long error”.I think that 80 (or 100) characters are a little short sometimes for the screens we have today.If you, as me, want to ignore this error (and/or others), you can create the file ~/.config/pycodestyle and specify what errors you want to ignore:[pycodestyle]ignore = E501And, that’s all. Now you can start to using Neovim as your Python IDE!ScreenshotsExample of autocompletionExample of linting errors and trailing whitespacesUnify Python lintingIf you’ve made it this far, you might be also interested in my post Unify Python Linting.

As I have argued, this is not a matter of arrogance, but of responsibility.2257686f2061726520796f752c207468656e3f22To put it simply: each of us owes a burden of loyalty to humanity itself, to the human project across time and space. This is not a minor matter, or some abstract issue for philosophers. It is a profound and significant part of every human life. It is a universal source of meaning and insight that can bind us together and set us on a path for a brighter future; and it is also a division, a line that must held against those who preach the gospel of self-annihilation.

We begin with the self because that is what determines our existence as individuals; but the self cannot exist without that which surrounds it. The citizen lives within the city; and the city lives within the cosmos.

This guide covers syntax, commands, best practices for a smooth transition, offers a good set of essential rules and includes bash script.Why?All our computers should be using a firewall.Especially those that expose services to the internet.Firewalls are crucial for mantaining the security of our network and protecting our data from external threats.They serve as a first line of defense against malware, cyber criminals and another threaths.In this times, it’s a matter of minutes that botnets finds your exposed service and start attacking it.And this could be the beginning of a bad story…I have an old raspberry pi exposing a SSH service to the internet, I need to connect to it remotely.The SSH access is secured using RSA authentication and fail2ban.But, once botnets discovers the SSH service running, the raspberry begins to receive such amount of petitions that the router is “ddosed” and the internet connection starts to cut.So I decided to set up a firewall to try to avoid network scans, at least those automated ones like those used by the botnets.I decided on iptables due to hardware and software restrictions, and, while I was at it, I also added protections to other kind of attacks and restrictions.I learned a lot along the way, and that’s why I decided to put a configuration file here that I think it’s a good starting point to harden our systems.Why not?nftables is replacing iptables.Basically, nftables, avoids duplication of work and inconsistencies, is easier to configure and mantain and is faster.So, if you are looking for a more comfortable and modern alternative, I invite you to read my article: Migrate from iptables to nftables.

Choose “Yes” for both if you have already configured your firewall.To save our current rulings (if we skipped during installation or we made changes):sudo netfilter-persistent save The iptables-persistent service is automatically configured to load the rules from iptables (ipv4) and ip6tables (ipv6) during system startup.Important considerations when using this iptables configurationIf you are going to use this as configuration basis rember a few things: Check the configuration and set the parameters of your computer (e.g.: set your computer ip address, interface[s], and the packet limits of the rules). These are basically protection rules and only allows basic common services as DNS, SSH, NTP and HTTP[S]. Below you have to add the rules that allow legitimate services traffic from your host. Think about your computer needs. Every host has needs and they may not be the same as mine. I set these rules without specify interfaces.In some hosts different interfaces have different needs. In iptables the order of the rules matter. Using the recent or limitmodules instead hashlimit could improve the performance. Don’t forget about IPv6. These are rules for IPv4, but changing the $bin variable to use ip6tables could apply to IPv6.Thanks to Rodrigo Rega for the tips and annotations :)Enjoy! ;)" }, { "title": "SSH legacy support", "url": "/posts/ssh-legacy-support/", "categories": "gnu/linux, administration", "tags": "gnu/linux, administration, ssh", "date": "2023-10-15 02:00:01 +0200", "snippet": "Sometimes we found ourselves in the need of connect from, or to, old devices.With the passage of time it may that these devices and/or their applications became non upgradeable.Meanwhile, SSH keeps...", "content": "Sometimes we found ourselves in the need of connect from, or to, old devices.With the passage of time it may that these devices and/or their applications became non upgradeable.Meanwhile, SSH keeps evolving and disabling insecure key exchange methods (among others).Of course, keep using these devices and applications, is not the most recommended from a security point of view, but, sometimes there’s no alternative.In my case I have an old phone with and old application which uses SSH.Both works very well, and neither can be updated.And I don’t think in replace either ot them in the short term.So, after a fresh install, or after replacing the SSH config file in an update, I know I have to add legacy support to SSH when I see the following message: Unable to negotiate with xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx port 22: no matching key exchange method found.

All your machines…Even if only one machine was compromised, I have to admit that it’s not one of the things I would like to suffer…There’s a few ways to block malicious domains, one of them is Steven Black’s hosts.It’s a great solution, but it has some downsides.First of all, you need to install it in every machine, generate custom host files and take care of keeping it updated (manually or scripting and scheduling a task).This could be ok if you have few machines and you have full access whenever you want to them.But, even so, may cause performance loss on some cases (above all on Windows machines).So, even I think Steven Black’s hosts it’s a great solution, and I use it myself on some machines, what else we can do?We can protect ourselves through our DNS Server.If our DNS server takes care of malware, phishing, spyware, botnets and other threats, we won’t have to!In the best case, if we had machines that never connect to another networks, we will only need change the DNS server on our router (if the router allows it).But, I don’t recommend only this, because, what is normal is that we have laptops and mobile devices that connects to many networks.Device DNS server configuracion usually take precedence over the router’s configuration.So, we will use our custom server although the router doesn’t allow the change and in any network.So, I recommend to change the DNS server in our router (if the router allows it) AND in every machine that we have.Setting a custom DNS server on the router will protect the devices that takes the router’s DNS server by default (such as a new -and unconfigured- computer, or the laptop and/or mobile phone of a family member or friend invited to our house).The proccess to set a custom DNS server differs quite a bit between Windows, GNU/Linux and Android, and between their versions, so I’m not going to go into how do it.The advantages of changing the DNS server, are that we only have to change it one time for each machine and for the router (if the router allows it).And we can keep Steven Black’s hosts as a second layer protection.And, even if we can keep it as updated as we want, we can sleep a bit more peacefully knowing that we are a little safer.Quad9The DNS server I chose to protect myself is Quad9.According to Wikipedia: Quad9 is a global public recursive DNS resolver that aims to protect users from malware and phishing. Quad9 is operated by the Quad9 Foundation, a Swiss public-benefit, not-for-profit foundation with the purpose of improving the privacy and cybersecurity of Internet users, headquartered in Zurich.It is the only global public resolver which is operated not-for-profit, in the public benefit.…Several independent evaluations have found Quad9 to be the most effective (97%) at blocking malware and phishing domains.…The domains which are filtered are not determined by Quad9, but instead supplied to Quad9 by a variety of independent threat-intelligence analysts, using different methodologies.Quad9 was the first to use standards-based strong cryptography to protect the privacy of its users’ DNS queries, and the first to use DNSSEC cryptographic validation to protect users from domain name hijackingQuad9 protects users’ privacy by not retaining or processing the IP address of its users, and is consequently GDPR-compliant.And, according to Quad9: The system uses threat intelligence from more than a dozen of the industry’s leading cybersecurity companies to give a real-time perspective on what websites are safe and what sites are known to include malware or other threats.So, it’s seems a great solution.Once we have seen the why and the how, all that remains is to set Quad9’s DNS servers as our new custom DNS servers:# Quad9's DNS servers for IPv4: 9.9.9.9, 149.112.112.112# Quad9's DNS servers for IPv6: 2620:fe::fe, 2620:fe::9Enjoy! ;)" }, { "title": "Google chrome adPrivacy", "url": "/posts/google-chrome-adprivacy/", "categories": "privacy, chrome", "tags": "privacy, chrome, google, adPrivacy", "date": "2023-09-11 02:00:01 +0200", "snippet": "If you use Chrome, and if you have Google Chrome version 115, you will have seen a new notice regarding privacy: “Enhanced ad privacy in Chrome”.According to Google: Chrome works to keep you safe ...", "content": "If you use Chrome, and if you have Google Chrome version 115, you will have seen a new notice regarding privacy: “Enhanced ad privacy in Chrome”.According to Google: Chrome works to keep you safe and protect your privacy while you browse.

Maybe. Or maybe not. But it’s a new way of tracking.So, if you want to disable (or enable) “Ad topics” and/or “Site-suggested adds” you can do it from: Three dot menu (on the right corner) &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy and Security (left menu)You can also access this settings typing chrome://settings/adPrivacy in the address bar.Enjoy! ;) You can find how “Ad topics” and “Site-suggested ads” work in more depth, in Google Chrome settings, in the “Learn more” section of each functionality. &#8617; " }, { "title": "Hack The Box Academy - Completed Web Requests", "url": "/posts/htba-web-requests/", "categories": "hack the box, academy", "tags": "hack the box, academy, web requests", "date": "2023-09-10 02:00:01 +0200", "snippet": "Completed Web RequestsCompleted Web Requests achievement", "content": "Completed Web RequestsCompleted Web Requests achievement" }, { "title": "Hack The Box Academy - Completed Introduction to Networking", "url": "/posts/htba-introduction-networking/", "categories": "hack the box, academy", "tags": "hack the box, academy, introduction, networking", "date": "2023-09-10 02:00:01 +0200", "snippet": "Completed Introduction to NetworkingCompleted Introduction to Networking achievement", "content": "Completed Introduction to NetworkingCompleted Introduction to Networking achievement" }, { "title": "Customizing default directory names on GNU/Linux", "url": "/posts/customizing-default-directory-names-gnu-linux/", "categories": "gnu/linux, administration", "tags": "gnu/linux, administration, directories, xdg", "date": "2023-09-02 02:00:01 +0200", "snippet": "Sometimes we don’t like default named directories as “Desktop” or “Downloads” and we prefer lowercase namings as “desktop” or “downloads”, name them in another language, or, simply, give them anoth...", "content": "Sometimes we don’t like default named directories as “Desktop” or “Downloads” and we prefer lowercase namings as “desktop” or “downloads”, name them in another language, or, simply, give them another name.Some applications create default named directories and it’s a pain to have duplicated directories and have to delete them later.Lucky for us, we can change this behavior gobally editing the /etc/xdg/user-dirs.defaults file or locally editing the ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs.As I prefer make the changes globally, I will edit the /etx/xdg/user-dirs.defaults.From manpages.debian.org: The /etc/xdg/user-dirs.defaults file is a text file that contains the default values for the XDG user dirs which are used by the xdg-user-dirs-update command.

NEVER run these commands on a mounted partition.Running a filesystem check in a mounted partition can cause catastrophic data loss or permanent corruption.fsckfsckis a generic wrapper (or front-end), it looks a the partition’s signature and then calls the appropiate checker for that system.$ sudo fsck -fccy /dev/sdb1Using the -cc option, any existing bad blocks in the bad blocks list are preserved, and any new bad blocks found by running badblocks will be added to the existing bad blocks list.Besides, with -cc option the bad block scan will be done using a non-destructive read-write test.e2fsckThis is the actual back-end tool, specifically designed for the ext family:$ sudo e2fsck -fccy /dev/sdb1badblocksWe could check for bad sectors with badblocks, but, unlike fsck and e2fsck, bad sectors will not be marked as unusable:$ sudo badblocks -nsv /dev/sdb1Check badblocks resultsTo see the blocks marked as bad in a ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem we have to use dumpe2fs:$ sudo dumpe2fs -b /dev/sdb1Enjoy! ;)" }, { "title": "Maintain HDD in GNU/Linux", "url": "/posts/maintenance-hdd-gnu-linux/", "categories": "gnu/linux, administration", "tags": "gnu/linux, administration, hdd, smartmontools, smartctl, fsck", "date": "2023-03-17 01:00:01 +0100", "snippet": "A hard disk drive (HDD) can suffer several types of failures: logical failures, mechanical failures or firmware failures.Since we cannot avoid mechanical or firmware failures, we will try to avoid ...", "content": "A hard disk drive (HDD) can suffer several types of failures: logical failures, mechanical failures or firmware failures.Since we cannot avoid mechanical or firmware failures, we will try to avoid (or minimize) logical failures.It’s a good practice to check the health of your HDD (Hard Disk Drives) from time to time and repair them if neccesary.It will avoid a lot of data loss and headaches.The process can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, but it’s worth it.Also, unless it is your main HDD, you can continue working while the disk is being checked and fixed.How can we check and fix our HDD in GNU/linux?Umount the diskFirst of all is know the device assigned to the disk we want to check.We can know the device assigned using fdisk -l or lsblk.Let’s say our disk is /dev/sdb.As the disk should be umounted to be able to run fsck, now, we need to umount it:$ sudo umount /dev/sdbCheck hard drive health using smartctlsmartctl is a utility contained on the smartmontools package.smartctl serves for check the HDD S.M.A.R.T.

Power_On_Hours: Count of hours in power-on state. It’s not useful to check for errors, but it’s useful to get an idea of the hours of life that the disk has left. Reported_Uncorrect: Reported Uncorrectable Errors. The count of errors that could not be recovered using hardware.

Frequency analysis can destroy repeating/fixed key substitution crypto. A feature of good crypto is random ciphertext. A good cipher must not reveal any clues about the plaintext. Since natural language plaintext (in this case, English) contains patterns, it is left up to the encryption key or the encryption algorithm to add the ‘randomness’. Modern ciphers are similar to older plain substitution ciphers, but improve the ‘random’ nature of the key. An example of an older cipher using a complex, random, large key is a vigniere using a key of the same size of the plaintext. For example, imagine you and your confident have agreed on a key using the book ‘A Tale of Two Cities’ as your key, in 256 byte blocks. The cipher works as such: Each plaintext message is broken into 256 byte blocks. For each block of plaintext, a corresponding 256 byte block from the book is used as the key, starting from the first chapter, and progressing. No part of the book is ever re-used as key. The use of a key of the same length as the plaintext,and only using it once is called a “One Time Pad”. Look in the krypton6 directory. You will find a file called ‘plain1’, a 256 byte block. You will also see a file ‘key1’, the first 256 bytes of ‘A Tale of Two Cities’.The file ‘cipher1’ is the cipher text of plain1. As you can see (and try) it is very difficult to break the cipher without the key knowledge. If the encryption is truly random letters, and only used once, then it is impossible to break. A truly random “One Time Pad” key cannot be broken.Consider intercepting a ciphertext message of 1000 bytes. One could brute force for the key, but due to the random key nature,you would produce every single valid 1000 letter plaintext as well. Who is to know which is the real plaintext?!? Choosing keys that are the same size as the plaintext is impractical. Therefore, other methods must be used to obscure ciphertext against frequency analysis in a simple substitution cipher. The impracticality of an ‘infinite’ key means that the randomness, or entropy, of the encryption is introduced via the method. We have seen the method of ‘substitution’. Even in modern crypto, substitution is a valid technique. Another technique is ‘transposition’, or swapping of bytes. Modern ciphers break into two types; symmetric and asymmetric. Symmetric ciphers come in two flavours: block and stream. Until now, we have been playing with classical ciphers, approximating ‘block’ ciphers. A block cipher is done in fixed size blocks (suprise!). For example, in the previous paragraphs we discussed breaking text and keys into 256 byte blocks, and working on those blocks.Block ciphers use a fixed key to perform substituion and transposition ciphers on each block discretely. Its time to employ a stream cipher. A stream cipher attempts to create an on-the-fly ‘random’ keystream to encrypt the incoming plaintext one byte at a time.Typically, the ‘random’ key byte is xor’d with the plaintext to produce the ciphertext. If the random keystream can be replicated at the recieving end,then a further xor will produce the plaintext once again. From this example forward, we will be working with bytes, not ASCII text, so a hex editor/dumper like hexdump is a necessity.Now is the right time to start to learn to use tools like cryptool. In this example, the keyfile is in your directory, however it is not readable by you. The binary ‘encrypt6’ is also available.It will read the keyfile and encrypt any message you desire, using the key AND a ‘random’ number.You get to perform a ‘known ciphertext’ attack by introducing plaintext of your choice.The challenge here is not simple, but the ‘random’ number generator is weak. As stated, it is now that we suggest you begin to use public tools, like cryptool, to help in your analysis.You will most likely need a hint to get going. See ‘HINT1’ if you need a kicktstart. If you have further difficulty, there is a hint in ‘HINT2’. The password for level 7 (krypton7) is encrypted with ‘encrypt6’. Good Luck!What do we know so far about this level? It’s a symmetric cipher It’s a stream cipher where the “random” key byte (k) is xor’d with the plain text (pt) to produce the ciphertext (ct):k ⊕ pt = ct k is a “random“ keystream. If the random keystream (k) can be replicated at the recieving end, then a further xor will produce the plaintext once again:k ⊕ pt = ct → pt ⊕ ct = k We will working with bytes. encrypt6 will read the keyfile and encrypt any message using the key AND a “random“ number. We have to perfom a known ciphertext attack The random number generator is weak. The password for Krypton Level 7 is encrypted with encrypt6.What can we learn from the clues?HINT1 The ‘random’ generator has a limited number of bits, and is periodic.Entropy analysis and a good look at the bytes in a hex editor will help.There is a pattern!HINT2 8 bit LFSRLFSRLFSR is used as a pseudo-random number generator for use in stream ciphers, but, as the register has a fine number of pssible states it must eventually enter a repeating cycle.This means that the numbers generated are periodic. A maximum-length LFSR will produce an m-secuence, so a 8 bit LFSR will produce a 8 bit sequence. The most commonly used linear function of single bits is exclusive-or (XOR ⊕). Thus, an LFSR is most often a shift register whose input bit is driven by the XOR of some bits of the overall shift register value. Given a stretch of known plaintext and corresponding ciphertext, an attacker can intercept and recover a stretch of LFSR output stream used in the system described, and from that stretch of the output stream can construct an LFSR of minimal size that simulates the intended receiver by using the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm. This LFSR can then be fed the intercepted stretch of output stream to recover the remaining plaintext.LFSR works by feeding on their own output.They are constructed in a way that makes them endlessly cycle through a pattern of values while outputting that seemingly random pattern.There’s a very graphic and good explanation about how a LFSR works in Random Numbers with LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) - Computerphile.The journey to solutionFail 1From the properties of XOR we know that:plaintext ⊕ key = ciphertext → ciphertext ⊕ key = plaintextAnd we know that:p ⊕ 0 = pBecause: p 0 p⊕0 0 0 0 1 0 1 So, If we put a bunch of zeros as input, we’ll get the key directly:plaintext ⊕ key = ciphertext → 0 ⊕ key = ciphertext → 0 ⊕ key = key → key = ciphertextkrypton6@bandit:/tmp/rubenhortas$ ln -s /krypton/krypton6/keyfile.dat krypton6@bandit:/tmp/rubenhortas$ python3 -c \"print('0'*50)\" &gt; zeros_pt.txtkrypton6@bandit:/tmp/rubenhortas$ /krypton/krypton6/encrypt6 zeros_pt.txt zeros_ct.txtAnd our key is… An empty file!

I mean, today it’s trivial to break a Vigenere Cipher.You can get the [cipher] key, in a matter of seconds, using offline or online cryptography tools, for example: dcode.But the purpose of this kind of challenges is to learn, not to get the key and run… So, although I knew the Vigenere Cipher, and I knew how to encrypt using it and how to break it using tools, I didn’t know how the process of breaking the encryption worked.So I got curious and I started to research…After a while I found a series of great videos in the youtube channel Theoretically: Vigenere Cipher - EncryptionThis video is an introduction to the Vigenere Cipher. Vigenere Cipher - Decryption (Known Key)This video shows how to decrypt the ciphertext with a known key. Vigenere Cipher - Decryption (Unknown Key)This video shows how to find the key length (I didn’t know at the time, but this part would be useful for the Krypton Level 5) and explains how to find the key.@Theoretically explains very well and uses very simple examples so that people understands the concepts easily.As the method seemed simple, I decided to give it a try and I started to coding a python script.But, what seemed like a, more or less, quick task it ended not to being so.Once started I found some blanks that I had to fill/solve in order to break the cipher and get the key, for example:Krypton Level 4 In Vigenere Cipher - Decryption (Unknown Key) 11:46 @Theoretically says “frecuencies of the numbers or the alphabet in order”.Ok, but… In what order? As in his example the letters and the frecuencies are a:0.10, b:0.20 and c:0.70 all is in order.The letters are in alphabetical order and the frecuencies are In increasing order…Later I would find out that the correct order is in alphabetical order. Finding the key shiftsIn @Theoretically’s example the characters of the ciphertext (ct) match the plaintext (pt) alphabet characters (A,B,C and a,b,c).What do we do when some characters do not appear in our frecuency analysys? We skip them or we add them? Are they important?Later I would find that, in order to perform the rotations to find the key shifts we will need a full (sorted in alphabetical order) alphabet.So, once we have our ciphertext (ct) frecuency analysis, we need to complete the alphabet and assign a frecuency of 0 to the missing characters. Krypton Level 5 What is the best way to get the rotations with most coincidences to get the shift length?I solved it calculating the median of the values of the rotation (directly with numpy).It is the best idea I came up with. How to discard the false positives finding the key length?Trying to finding the key length I found some false positives. But after a few debugging and thinking I found that was a logic error in programming. I’m sure that I’m forgetting some doubts that arose while solving this game levels, but I think that these were the most important ones.Answering these questions was a processs that involved more research and a programming method based on trial and error with a lot of debugging and thinking.Was it worth it?I’d like to think so. In the process of solving these challenges I was very entertained and I learned a few things, for example: I learned how to works the process to break a Vigenere Cipher through this method. I learned about other methods to break a Vigenere Cipher, to find the key length and to find the key. I improved my python list slicing skills.To solve the Krypton Level 4 and Krypton Level 5 I did a python script that you can see at vigenere_decrypter.pyEnjoy! ;)" }, { "title": "Don't add host key to shh known_hosts", "url": "/posts/dont-add-hostkey-to-ssh-known-hosts/", "categories": "privacy, ssh", "tags": "privacy, ssh, known_hosts", "date": "2022-10-28 02:00:01 +0200", "snippet": "The known_hosts is a file stored in the user home, in ~/.shh/known_hosts.The use of the known_hosts file is optional, but this file ensures the identities of the hosts and avoids man in the middle ...", "content": "The known_hosts is a file stored in the user home, in ~/.shh/known_hosts.The use of the known_hosts file is optional, but this file ensures the identities of the hosts and avoids man in the middle attacks when we connect to a host via ssh.Everytime we connect to a host via ssh, if is a new host, the system prompts us whether we want to add the remote host to known_hosts file.If we accept to add the remote host to the known_host file the host’s public key is stored in the known_host file and the host becomes a known host.When we connect to a known host via ssh the system checks the public key of the remote host, and, if there was any change on the remote host public key we would be alerted.Of course, there are some situatons for which the public key change is legit, but it is our responsability to check it with the server’s administrator (or sysadmin).Altough using the known_hosts file is the right way to ensure the identity of the remote host and secure our connection, there are some situations where we may prefer not to add the host to the kwnown_hosts file.We may prefer not to add it for privacy reasons or, for example, if we regularly play cybersecurity capture the flag games (ctfs or wargames) (even if using a virtual machine) we will end with a lot of useless entries on our known_hosts file.We can avoid add the public key of the new host to the known_hosts file for a single session using: -o “UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null”ssh user@newhost -o \"UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null\"But, if we want to avoid add the public keys of new hosts permanently we should update our ssh config (~/.ssh/config to do it at user level or /etc/ssh/ssh_config to do it at system level) and add or comment the following lines:# We can specify the hosts from which the public keys will not be saved with a regex. # If you are going to use this option use the strictest regex you can.# If you want to avoid adding any public key of any host you can skip the Host lineHost *.mydomain.com StrictHostKeyChecking no UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null User foo # For the given user (optional) LogLevel QUIET # Will keep the warning message from showing upEnjoy! ;)" }, { "title": "Redirect stderr to stdout", "url": "/posts/redirect-stderr-stdout-gnu-linux/", "categories": "gnu/linux, bash", "tags": "gnu/linux, bash", "date": "2022-10-21 02:00:01 +0200", "snippet": "Sometimes we met with shell commands that includes the “2&gt;&amp;1” string at the end.If we don’t the meaning of “2&gt;&amp;1” it’s easy that we forgot the syntax.So, what does “2&gt;&amp;1” mean?...", "content": "Sometimes we met with shell commands that includes the “2&gt;&amp;1” string at the end.If we don’t the meaning of “2&gt;&amp;1” it’s easy that we forgot the syntax.So, what does “2&gt;&amp;1” mean?2&gt;&amp;1 is the way to redirect the standard error (stderr) to the standard output (stdout).How 2&gt;&amp;1 works?The standard input (stdin) is the file descriptor 0.The standard output (stdout) is the file descriptor 1.The standard error (stderr) is the file descriptor 2.”&gt;” is the unix file redirection operator. “&gt;” is used to redirect the contents of a command or file to another by overwritting it.If we want to redirect the standard error (stderr, 2) to the standard output (stdout, 1) we could think of doing:command 2&gt;1But this will redirect the standard error (stderr) to a file named 1.“&amp;” indicates that what follows is a file descriptor and not a file name, so the way to redirect the standard error (stderr) to the standard output (stdout) is:command 2&gt;&amp;1And, if we want to discard all the command exit (stdin and stdout) we can send it to the “bitbucket” (also known as /dev/null):command &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1Although, if we want to discard all the command exit (stdin and stdout), another way (and, inmho, the most correct way) would be:command &amp;&gt;/dev/null /dev/null is a pseudo device (or virtual device) file in GNU/Linux. /dev/null works like a black hole, as soon as any data is written to /dev/null the data is deleted.Enjoy! ;)" }, { "title": "Hack The Box - ExploitedStream pwned!", "url": "/posts/htb-exploitedstream/", "categories": "hack the box, challenge", "tags": "hack the box, challenge, misc, htb, ExploitedStream", "date": "2022-10-15 02:00:01 +0200", "snippet": "Description An npm stream compromised dependencies long ago.

The first number is an encrypted character (ct) and the second number is the flag used to encrypt it.We take a look at the FLAG list generation:def AppendFlag(flag):\tFLAGS.append(strchr(bitxor(flag, 0x4A)))Here we can see that the flags written in the output are xored with the key 0x4A.We need to keep this in mind in order to get the flags used for the characters encryption.The encryptionIf we take a look to the function used to encrypt the characters:def EncryptCharacter(char):\tchar = ValidateChar(char)\tflag = GenerateFlag()\tif CheckFlag(flag, FL_SWAPBYTES):\t\tchar = ESwapChar(char)\tif CheckFlag(flag, FL_NEGATE):\t\tchar = NegateChar(char)\tif CheckFlag(flag, FL_XORBY6B):\t\tchar = XorBy6B(char)\tif CheckFlag(flag, FL_XORBY3E):\t\tchar = XorBy3E(char)\treturn char, flagWe can see that the first thing done is a character validation:strbyt = lambda x, y=0: ord(x[y])def ValidateChar(char):\tif type(char) is str and len(char) == 1:\t\tchar = strbyt(char)\treturn charThe only thing that does the ValidateChar() function is return the ordinal of the character if the character has length 1, otherwise returns the character.Then, the EncryptCharacter() function generates the flag. The flag generation is completely random and several flags may be activated at the same time.Finally, the EncryptCharacter() function, checks if the flags FL_SWAPBYTES, FL_NEGATE, FL_XORBY6B and FL_XORBY3E are activated and, depending on which ones are activated, the encryption functions are applied to the character.As several flags can be activated simultaneously, and the encrypting operations are applied in order, a character can undergo several encryptions.We need to keep this in mind in order to reverse this part.Decrypting the messageReading the outputAs the output is written by pairs of numbers, and the first number is the encrypted character, and the second number is the encrypted flag, we can read the output and separate the encrypted characters and the encrypted flags.Decrypting the flagsAs the flags are encrypted xoring the flag with the 0x4A key, by the properties of XOR, we can obtain the plaintext flags only by xoring the encrypted flags with the same key.pt ⊕ key = ct → ct ⊕ key = ptReversing the EncryptCharacter() functionSince there can be several flags active at the same time, and the encryption functions are applied in order, the only thing we need to do is to reverse the order of the functions applied:def DecryptCharacter(char, flag): char = ValidateChar(char) if CheckFlag(flag, FL_XORBY3E): char = XorBy3E(char) if CheckFlag(flag, FL_XORBY6B): char = XorBy6B(char) if CheckFlag(flag, FL_NEGATE): char = NegateChar(char) if CheckFlag(flag, FL_SWAPBYTES): char = InvertESwapChar(char) if type(char) is int: char = strchr(char) return charReversing XorBy3E, XorBy6B and NegateCharAs these functions are only xorings (remember the XOR properties: pt ⊕ key = ct → ct ⊕ key = pt) and a negation, the inverse of these functions are the same functions.Reversing ESwapChar() functionThis is the tricky part of the challenge.Once you understand what it does, reversing it is pretty straightforward (although I spent more time on it than I’d like to assume…).def ESwapChar(char):\tchar = ValidateChar(char)\tTHIS_MSB = bitext(char, 4, 4)\tTHIS_LSB = bitext(char, 0, 4)\treturn strchr(bitbor(bitxor(THIS_MSB, 0x0D), bitxor(bitlst(THIS_LSB, 4), 0xB0)))What does this function do?The first thing this function does is validate the character (we’ve seen before that this returns the ordinal of the character if the character has length 1, otherwise returns the character).Then declares two variables (in capital letters!? Really? ¬¬!): THIS_MSB and THIS_LSBLastly, this function applies some operations to THIS_MSB and THIS_LSB to get the encrypted char.Let’s simplify the encrypt function a bit:* strchr = lambda x: chr(x)* bitbor = lambda x, y: x | y → or* bitxor = lambda x, y: x ^ y → xor* bitlst = lambda x, y: x &lt;&lt; y → Left shift, moves x to the left y places return strchr(bitbor(bitxor(THIS_MSB, 0x0D), bitxor(bitlst(THIS_LSB, 4), 0xB0))) →→ ct = strchr(bitbor(bitxor(THIS_MSB, 0x0D), bitxor(bitlst(THIS_LSB, 4), 0xB0))) →→ ct = chr(OR[XOR(THIS_MSB, 0x0D), XOR(bitlst(THIS_LSB, 4), 0xB0)])→ ct = chr[(THIS_MSB ⊕ 0x0D) | (bitlst(THIS_LSB, 4) ⊕ 0xB0)]We can see that the operation is a chr() applied over an OR between two XORs, so we’ll need to start by reversing the two XORs.Left XOR: XOR(THIS_MSB, 0x0D)Ok, as this part it’s a simpe XOR between THIS_MSB and 0x0D, what does THIS_MSB do?* bitrst = lambda x, y: x &gt;&gt; y → Right shift, moves x to the right y places* bitext = lambda x, y, z=1: bitrst(x, y) &amp; int(math.pow(2, z) - 1) = # the value of z will be overriden by the value of the caller function = (x &gt;&gt; y) &amp; int(math.pow(2, z) - 1)* THIS_MSB = bitext(char, 4, 4) = = (char &gt;&gt; 4) &amp; int(math.pow(2, 4) - 1) = # SWAP!

So, what does bitlst(THIS_LSB, 4) do?* THIS_LSB = bitext(char, 0, 4)* bitext = (x &gt;&gt; y) &amp; int(math.pow(2, z) - 1) # the value of z will be overriden by the value of the caller function → THIS_LSB = (char &gt;&gt; 0) &amp; int(math.pow(2, 4) - 1) = = char &amp; int(math.pow(2, 4) - 1) = = char &amp; 15* bitlst = lambda x, y: x &lt;&lt; y # SWAP!

machines.In theory, to this day, Microsoft has fixed this bug, but it did not work for me.So after a bit of googling I saw that other solutions were to uninstall a couple of updates and prevent them from being reinstalled or edit the windows registry to disable the security patch.I ruled out the option to uninstall updates and set windows update not to install them again, basically for the following reasons: The user does not have an advanced profile and it is very possible that he will reinstall the updates by updating windows, and then he will be left without printers again… The time it would take to uninstall certain updates one by one and test if the error was fixed The chance of someone exploiting that vulnerability in that environment is very remote The vulnerability does not seem criticalOnce the windows update related options were discarded, the only thing left to do was to give it a try to edit the windows registry…Editing the windows registry to disable CVE-2021-1678

do we start to configure it?Preparing the configuration filesWe will store our configuration file and theme under the .config/ folder in our /home$ mkdir -p ~/.config/awesome/themes/rubenNow, we will copy the default awesome configuration file and theme to edit them and configure to our liking.$ sudo cp /etc/xdg/awesome/rc.lua ~/.config/awesome$ sudo cp /usr/share/awesome/themes/default/theme.lua ~/.config/awesome/themes/rubenConfiguring awesomeIn this section we will edit the ~/.config/awesome/rc.lua file.Setting the themeWe need to set our theme path as the parameter passed to beautiful.init:beautiful.init(\"/home/ruben/.config/awesome/themes/ruben/theme.lua\")Customizing our environmentTo do this, wi will edit our ~/.config/awesome/rc.lua file, and we will configure a few sections.Window layoutsMostly, I only use the maximized layout, but I leave the floating layout for applications that starts with a login dialog, the calculator, and so.So in the next section I comment all the others: awful.layout.layouts = { awful.layout.suit.floating, -- awful.layout.suit.tile, -- awful.layout.suit.tile.left, -- awful.layout.suit.tile.bottom, -- awful.layout.suit.tile.top, -- awful.layout.suit.fair, -- awful.layout.suit.fair.horizontal, -- awful.layout.suit.spiral, -- awful.layout.suit.spiral.dwindle, awful.layout.suit.max, -- awful.layout.suit.max.fullscreen, -- awful.layout.suit.magnifier, -- awful.layout.suit.corner.nw, -- awful.layout.suit.corner.ne, -- awful.layout.suit.corner.sw, -- awful.layout.suit.corner.se, }TagsIn this section we will configure the number of tags we want and their text.I only use 2 tags in each screen, and, really, I change the numbers for hack nerd font characters.awful.tag({ \"1\", \"2\" }, s, awful.layout.layouts[1])Menu bar launcherI don’t use the menu bar from the wibar, neither in the mouse (I prefer the Super+p or Super+r shortcuts), so I comment the following awesome menu sections:--myawesomemenu = {-- { \"hotkeys\", function() hotkeys_popup.show_help(nil, awful.screen.focused()) end },-- { \"manual\", terminal .. \" -e man awesome\" },-- { \"edit config\", editor_cmd .. \" \" .. awesome.conffile },-- {

widgets{ -- Left widgets layout = wibox.layout.fixed.horizontal, --mylauncher, s.mytaglist, s.mypromptbox,},Right widgetsIn this section we will comment all the widgets that will not use, later we can add ours.I only want to keep the clock widget, so I comment the others:{ -- Right widgets layout = wibox.layout.fixed.horizontal, -- mykeyboardlayout, -- wibox.widget.systray(), mytextclock, -- s.mylayoutbox,},Custom key bindingsFirst of all I interchange the Super+j and Super+k keybinndings, is more intiutive this way for me.One of the advantages to use a tiling window manager is have our custom shortcuts, so I always add a few.For example, if we want a shortcut to firefox, we will edit the Key bindings section and add:awful.key({ modkey }, \"f\", function() awful.util.spawn(\"firefox\") end, {description = \"firefox\", group = \"internet\"}) Be careful in this step. The previous entry has to end with a colon, and the last entry in this section has to end without colon.Mapping applications to screen tagsIf we want an application always running in a screen tag, we only have to set a rule.For example, if we want that MPlayer runs always in the tag 1 of screen 2:{ rule = { class = \"MPlayer\" }, properties = { screen = 2, tag = \"1\" } },Removing gapsFor some reason, some windows, in maximized mode, have gaps at the right and bottom. To remove the gaps I add the size_hints_honor = false to the rules{ rule_any = {type = { \"normal\", \"dialog\" } }, properties = { titlebars_enabled = false, size_hints_honor = false }},Configuring our themeIn this section we will edit the our theme file, in my case: ~/.config/awesome/themes/ruben/theme.luaFontI find the default font a bit small, so I change it and set one a little bit bigger:theme.font = \"Hack Nerd Font Mono Regular 9\"Taglist fontI like to see the taglists very big, so I set their font to one bigger:theme.taglist_font=\"Hack Nerd Font Mono Regular 16\"WallpaperWe can set our wallpaper editing the theme.wallpaper value:theme.wallpaper = themes_path..\"ruben/background.jpg\"If we don’t have our wallpaper on the themes_path, we can set it with adding its absolute path:theme.wallpaper = themes_path..\"/home/ruben/images/wallpaper.jpg\"Add widgetsWe can add our widgets to end the configuration. A good startingp point is https://github.com/streetturtle/awesome-wm-widgetlogout-menu-widgetI usually install the logout-menu-widget.And I have to fix it: Fixing awesome logout-menu-widget.Custom widgetsI want to see the CPU and memory (RAM) usage, so I add a couple of custom widgets based on vicious to do it.To do this, as these widgets are based on vicious I have to add the following line at the beginning of the rc.lua file:local vicious = require(\"vicious\")Then, after the following section of the rc.lua file -- Create a tasklist widget s.mytasklist = awful.widget.tasklist(s, awful.widget.tasklist.filter.currenttags, tasklist_buttons)I add my two custom widgets: -- CPU widget cpuwidget = wibox.widget.textbox() cpuwidget.forced_width=65 vicious.register(cpuwidget, vicious.widgets.cpu, \" CPU: $1%\", 2) -- MEM widget memwidget = wibox.widget.textbox() memwidget.forced_width=65 vicious.register(memwidget, vicious.widgets.mem, \" MEM: $1%\", 2)And then I add the two custom widgets to the wibos on the positions that I want.Configuring the clock (mytextclock or textclock) format:I only want to see the hour and the minutes. If you, as me, want another time format you only need to pass the date format to the textclock() function:mytextclock = wibox.widget.textclock(\" %H:%M \") The formats are the same as in the linux date commandMy own widgets (ip and hackthebox)You also may find interesting my own awesome widgets: awesome ip widget awesome htb widgetGTK applications with dark themeFor personal reasons I usually work with dark themes, but awesome does not have one, is not its job.If you, as me, want applications in dark mode and you have installed gtk applications, you only have to modify the settings.ini files contained in the gtk-*.*/ directories under ~./config and set:gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme=1Default browserIf we have many browsers installed and we want to use one of them as default browser, for instance firefox, we will find that some applications will open the links in another browser.To solve this we will need to set the default browser, system-wide and user-specific. For instance, in debian:System-wide$ sudo update-alternatives --config x-www-browserUser-specific$ xdg-settings set default-web-browser firefox-esr.desktopAutostart applicationsIf we want execute applications and/or scripts when our awesome starts, we have to add it at the end of the ~/.config/awesome/rc.lua, e.g.:-- Autostartawful.spawn.with_shell(\"~/scripts/my_config_script\")Backup and cleanWhen we have awesome running configured to our liking, we can make a backup of our configuration files and themes, then we can remove the commented lines and their associated sections and/or declarations.

Can you help me recover it?SolutionWhen we extract the Lost Modulus.zip file we found two files: challenge.py → The script used for the custom RSA implementation output.txt → The encrypted flagWe take a look at the challenge.py script and the RSA implmentation seems legit…We can see that the script is trying to open a flag.txt file:flag = open('flag.txt', 'r').read().strip().encode()And we can see that the given encrypted flag is written in hexadecimal:print ('Flag:', crypto.encrypt(flag).hex())Fist of all, I will apply the pep 8 coding conventios to the script, because it’s giving me the creeps… :SThen I will create the flag.txt file and with the hexadecimal flag contained in the output.txt file (without the ‘Flag: ‘ part).And now… I found two solutions for this challenge:The easy waySince the script has the decrypt function, and seems legit, the first thing is to give it a try… Eventually it will works. So we can automatize this process with a little function:def decrypt_flag(crypto):\tencrypted_flag_hex = flag.decode()\tencrypted_flag_bytes = bytes.fromhex(encrypted_flag_hex)\tdecrypted_flag_bytes = b'' \twhile b'HTB{' not in decrypted_flag_bytes: \t\tdecrypted_flag_bytes = crypto.decrypt(encrypted_flag_bytes)\tprint('Decrypted flag bytes: ', decrypted_flag_bytes)We call the function from the main passing crypto as argument and wait for it to finish.To do this I only modified the challenge.py script. You can see the full script at EasyWay.pyThe cube root attackIs one of the simpliest attacks on RSA. When encrypting with low encryption exponents (i.e. e = 3) and small values of the m (i.e. m &lt; n1/e), the result of m^e is strictly less than the modulus n. In this case, the modulus n loses its importance, has no effect, and the encryption goes from (m^e)%n to m^e; so: ct = (m^e)%n = m^e and ciphertext can be decrypted easily taking the eth root of the ciphertext: pt = sqrt(e, ct); in this case pt = sqrt(3, m).To solve this challenge, I did a self-explanatory python script that you can see at CubeRootAttack.pyLost Modulus has been PwnedEnjoy! ;)" }, { "title": "Start a program automatically on Windows 10", "url": "/posts/start-program-automatically-windows10/", "categories": "windows10, administration", "tags": "windows10, administration", "date": "2022-08-19 02:00:01 +0200", "snippet": "Usually, the ideal is to have the minimum programs running at startup on windows, but sometimes we need to add some program to the startup.To get a program run at startup on Windows 10: Press the ...", "content": "Usually, the ideal is to have the minimum programs running at startup on windows, but sometimes we need to add some program to the startup.To get a program run at startup on Windows 10: Press the keys: win+r On the run box write the next command: shell:startup Drag the shortcut to the program that we want to run at startup to the window that just opened.

Can you figure it out and open the door?SolutionWhen we extract the Deterministic.zip file we only found the deterministic.txt file.If we take a look at the deterministic.txt content, we can see a few things:The states are correct but just for security reasons, each character of the password is XORed with a very super secret key.100 H 110110 T 111111 B 112112 { 113113 l 114114 0 115115 l 116116 _ 117117 n 118118 0 119119 p 120120 e 121121 } 122We can assume that the first column is the current state, the second column is the xored character of the password and the third column is the next state.And the character of the password is xored with a very super secret key with length one (remember the statement) ;)A deterministic system will always produce the same output from a initial state.So, to solve this challenge, the first thing is get the secuence of states, starting from 69420 and ending in 999.Concatenating the characters associated to this states we will have the xored password.Once we got the xored password, we need to bruteforce it with a key o length one (It shouldn’t take long ;)) to get the plaintext password (our flag).Lastly, once we have bruteforced the xored password, we will analyze the ouputs, and we will keep the only one that makes sense (and the only one that has the flag :P).To solve this challenge I did a python script that you can see here: deterministic.pyEnjoy!

A place where you can talk, discuss and, above all, learn from other developers with more experience in other areas.Last Friday I had the opportunity to inaugurate the talks with “Python 101 for developers”. The talk is an introduction to Python, skipping basic things, emphasizing, above all, the differences, advantages and disadvantages that Python presents with respect to other programming languages. Leaving for the end certain annotations that I considered necessary, although I could not go deeper into them due to the extension of the topics to which they refer.From here I want to thank the guys from Coruña Developers for the opportunity and the experience (also the treatment received), and the attendees for the interest and curiosity shown. The truth is that for me it has been a very positive experience, and I hope it was productive for the attendees.Although I know that for the non-attendees the slides and examples may be too short, by consensus with the organization and the attendees, I have decided to upload the material used (slides and code examples). While the services that will serve as common points to host all the material generated by the Coruña Developers project are being created, I have uploaded the slides and examples used to my github account.For non-attendees, this documentation may be short because it is out of context. Since it is simply support material (brief notes and simple examples) for the talk. Material that serves to provide structure, consistency and an argumentative thread to the narration. Material that, due to its format, leaves out certain topics and nuances that are commented on during the talk. However, it may still be of interest.Personally, and after talking with the organizers about the ideas they have, I think it is a very interesting initiative. I am sure I will be there in future occasions, initially as an attendee, but who knows! Maybe in the future I will have the opportunity to repeat as a speaker ;)You can follow the activities of Coruña Developers on their facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/groups/CorunaDevelopers and/or on their twitter: @CorunaDevEnjoy! ;)" }, { "title": "In La brecha again", "url": "/posts/in-la-brecha-again/", "categories": "personal, mentions", "tags": "personal, mentions, wifi, security", "date": "2014-03-13 01:00:01 +0100", "snippet": "I’m pleased to announce that, again, I’m in La brecha.This time with my PFC (Proyecto Final de Carrera or Final Career Project) “Sistema de monitorización de redes WI-FI” (WI-FI network monitoring ...", "content": "I’m pleased to announce that, again, I’m in La brecha.This time with my PFC (Proyecto Final de Carrera or Final Career Project) “Sistema de monitorización de redes WI-FI” (WI-FI network monitoring system).A job that integrates both the world of systems and software development in a totally friendly environment for monitoring and detecting anomalies in WIFI networks.My most sincere thanks to Nino and Fran for the work done and for being the best director and the best tutor I could have had.Enjoy! ;)" }, { "title": "SSH without password, using RSA keys", "url": "/posts/ssh-without-password-using-rsa-keys/", "categories": "hardening, ssh", "tags": "hardening, ssh, security, rsa, networking", "date": "2013-09-15 02:00:01 +0200", "snippet": "Suppose we have two computers: computer1 with ip 10.0.0.1 and computer2 with ip 10.0.0.2.We connect very frequently from computer1 to computer2 using SSH.As we connect very frequently, entering the...", "content": "Suppose we have two computers: computer1 with ip 10.0.0.1 and computer2 with ip 10.0.0.2.We connect very frequently from computer1 to computer2 using SSH.As we connect very frequently, entering the password every time we connect becomes a repetitive task and a waste of time.In order to be able to connect between them without password, in a comfortable and secure way, we can do it using RSA keys instead.Connection between computersTo be able to connect via SSH using the RSA keys instead password:We generate the public and private RSA keys on computer1:rubenhortas@computer1:~/.ssh$ ssh-keygen -t rsaGenerating public/private rsa key pair.Enter file in which to save the key (/home/rubenhortas/.ssh/id_rsa):Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):Enter same passphrase again:Your identification has been saved in /home/rubenhortas/.ssh/id_rsa.Your public key has been saved in /home/rubenhortas/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.The key fingerprint is:**:**:**:**:**:**:**:**:**:**:**:**:**:**:**:**The key's randomart image is:*You have to leave the passphrase empty, otherwise it will ask for it every time we connect to computer2 via SSHWe copy the public key from computer1 to computer2:rubenhortas@computer1$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 10.0.0.2The authenticity of host '10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2)' can't be established.RSA key fingerprint is **:**:**:**:**:**:**:**:**:**:**:**:**:**:**:**.Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keysrubenhortas@10.0.0.2's password:Finally, we connect from computer1 to computer2 using SSH and checking that it does not ask us for the password.Enjoy! ;)" }, { "title": "Seguridad Jabali", "url": "/posts/seguridad-jabali/", "categories": "personal, mentions", "tags": "personal, mentions, security", "date": "2012-04-15 02:00:01 +0200", "snippet": "I’m pleased to announce that I’m the recomendation of today in Seguridad Jabali (es).Seguridad Jabali (es) it’s a great blog about computer security which deals with many interesting topics.
